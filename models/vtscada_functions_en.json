It is reset automatically when it appears in a true action trigger (IF), or when it appears in a function that resets its parameters. The parameters are relative to  local time. If attempting to schedule an event for the same time across servers in multiple time zones, the offset should be an expression relative to each time zone. Note that the behavior will differ depending on whether you use this function in a script code module or in a tag expression. In script code, the function will be reset as described, and will wait for the next trigger to occur. In a tag expression, this function will not be reset after triggering. Because AbsTime is ultimately based on midnight January 1st, 1970 (a Thursday), it is possible in theory to use it for a weekly time interval, with an appropriate offset for the day of the week starting from Thursday. In practice, TimeArrived may be more appropriate for a weekly trigger. VTScada includes an application property at the \\Code level named SecondFlasher. The value of this property changes from 0 to 1 once a second, as near as possible to the change of the second. In most cases, it is better to watch for the change of \\SecondFlasher than to burden the system with an additional function to calculate one-second intervals.",

    "comments": "If the statement succeeds, a COM client interface is returned, allowing subsequent access to the object. If it fails, Invalid is returned. There are two significant parametric differences between an ActiveX function and a COMClient function. Firstly, the ActiveX function requires a client window in which to draw. Secondly, there is no ObjectContext parameter. ActiveX objects are only instantiated in process, as they require direct GDI access to process resources [such as the client window area]. A window in VTScada acts as a container for ActiveX objects, in the true OLE definitions of the OC96 specification. This architecture provides a container enumerator so that an ActiveX object can interact with other ActiveX objects in the same container. Like the COMClient function, this function returns an opaque COM Client Interface handle, through which subsequent object manipulations are performed. Refer to the documentation for the ActiveX object you are creating for properties, methods, and events. Unlike the COMClient function, this statement may be only be used as a steady-state statement. The ActiveX object will only remain instantiated while the steady-state statement is still running (i.e. a change of state or destruction of the module instance which is running the statement will cause the ActiveX object to be destroyed). Any variables that hold a handle to the COM Client Interface will be invalidated at that time. When an ActiveX control is running in a thin client session, numeric values are limited to double floating-point values, whereas an ActiveX control running on the server can use full 64-bit integers. Therefore numeric values with a magnitude over 9007199254740992 may lose precision when passed into or out of an ActiveX control. Within an Anywhere Client session, this function does nothing.",

The object value will become Invalid when the asynchronous operation completes. At that time (or when the method returns Invalid), the value addressed by PtrReturnCode can be examined to determine the status of the operation. The contents of the value addressed by PtrReturnCode are undefined until the method returns Invalid. A single account can be added by supplying a single AccountData structure in NewAccountData. Multiple accounts can be added in one operation by providing a single dimension array or dictionary of AccountData structures in NewAccountData. The result code returned in the value addressed by PtrReturnCode will be a scalar value if a single structure was supplied in NewAccountData. If an array of structures or a dictionary of structures was supplied, a single dimension array of the same size as NewAccountData will be returned in the value addressed by PtrReturnCode, each element containing the result code for the corresponding NewAccountData element. Adding an account requires a working copy write lock. If such a lock is held by the calling code, the HaveLock parameter must be set to TRUE. Otherwise omit this parameter or set it to FALSE.

(Assuming the Function is ==) To activate, trip, clear and acknowledge a unique instance of an ad hoc alarm, you must refer to the alarm using the same Name. At a minimum, you need to configure Name, Area, Description, Priority and Setpoint. Other alarm configuration options are available such as Function, Trip, OnDelay, Deadband, Units, Custom, etc. It is not necessary to set the AdHoc field since that is set by AdHocAlarm(). The Name field must be unique among all alarms, including ad hoc alarms. A FriendlyName should not be specified for an ad hoc alarm since it is not logged or distributed to other servers.

If your application predates version 11.2, use the backslash notation rather than dot: \\System\\ Beware of the following edge cases: Behavior may be undefined if the same key is added twice. For example, with the default setting (CaseInsensitive==FALSE), ArrayToDictionary(MakeArray(\"A\", \"a\"), MakeArray(1, 2)) gives Dictionary(âAâ:2). The later value overwrites the earlier value. Assigning certain special characters may break the whole dictionary. For example, ArrayToDictionary(MakeArray(\"A\", \"a\", ââ), MakeArray(1, 2, 3)) returns a numeric value 3. A len(0) string is taken as Invalid, and is not allowed as key. As a result, the returned address is the dictionary itself instead of the dictionary[key], and the value is then stored in the dictionary itself. The Value that should be assigned to dictionary[key] is then assigned to the dictionary itself (in our example, itâs 3). Dict[\"\"] has the same behavior as RootValue(Dict). ArrayToDictionary should detect a \"\" key and either fail entirely or leave out that item, and the behavior should be documented.",

        "description": "Optional dictionary. May be used to specify a subset of variables or modules from the ModuleOrObject parameter that will be loaded, launched, or both, into the child bubble rather than loading and launching the entire module. This is of use when you want to share the same code between modules running inside and outside of the child bubble. When an ImportDictionary is provided, the entire Module is not loaded into the bubble to be run. Instead, a copy of ModuleOrObject is reconstructed in the bubble with none of its states and with only the subset of variables specified in the ImportDictionary. This is then launched in the bubble. In this situation, the root module is like a library of modules and objects that you want to selectively import into the bubble, with the actual bubble worker module being one of the modules imported. The keys to the dictionary are the names of variables in ModuleOrObject, and the values can be any one of the following: If the key specifies a variable containing a module or object, then setting the value to FALSE means that the module will be fully loaded into the bubble and placed in the corresponding variable, but it will not be launched. If the key specifies a variable containing a module or object, then setting the value to TRUE means that the module will be fully loaded into the bubble and launched, with the object being placed in the corresponding variable. If the key specifies a variable containing a module or object, then you can set the value to a nested ImportDictionary. A nested ImportDictionary is the same as the top-level one, except that it operates on the module or object specified in the dictionary key. The resulting reconstructed object is placed in the corresponding variable. If the dictionary value is Invalid, then any packable value is imported into the bubble and placed in the corresponding variable. Note that static arrays are converted to dynamic arrays as a part of the import process. Any local variable in the object or module can be imported, regardless of whether it is protected. It is typical to have one fully loaded and launched module that will perform the work that the bubble has been created for. The other imported modules and variables would be common code that the bubble worker module uses and which is also used outside the bubble. Imported variables are populated inside the bubble in the order that they were added to the import dictionary. Therefore, if (for example) an imported and launched module has a Constructor that references another imported module, you will need to add the other module to the import dictionary first so that it is ready to be used when the Constructor runs."
      }
    ],
    "comments": "The Bubble function only loads and launches modules into the new bubble. It will often be necessary to provide input data values to the new bubble. These can be sent after the Bubble call using the BubbleSend function. Modules that are loaded into a child bubble are loaded independently, and therefore do not share \"Shared\" variables with the copy of the module that exists in the parent object. Bubbles must refrain from setting retained values that could be set in another bubble. They must use SetInstanceName to give their object a unique name before setting any instance variables. At the same time, parent bubbles should refrain from writing to the retained variable using the default instance name in a module that could be loaded inside a child bubble. Otherwise, they risk corrupting the retained value, or loading a partially-written retained value The bubble will continue to exist for as long as there are objects running within the bubble. After the last object within the bubble in slain and all outstanding related work within the bubble is finished, the bubble will tear itself down. Note that slaying the object that started the bubble will not stop the bubble. The bubble must tear itself down, either on its own or upon receipt of a message from its parent bubble telling it to do so. The bubble handle returned by this function is not invalidated when the bubble tears itself down. If a parent bubble needs to know when a child bubble is finished, then the child bubble should send the parent bubble a message before terminating. A parent bubble does not need to retrieve that message before the child bubble terminates. This is a reason why the bubble handle is not invalidated when the child bubble finishes, as the parent bubble may still need to retrieve one or more messages via the child bubble handle. When ImportDictionary is not provided, ModuleOrObject will only be successfully loaded into the bubble if it has no static references to external variables since it is loaded with no parent. When ImportDictionary is provided, any modules that it fully imports (dictionary value TRUE or FALSE) cannot statically reference any external variables that are not also being imported, or else they will fail to load in the bubble. So, if you are importing ModuleA and it contains a reference to ModuleB, youâll need to import ModuleB. In order to do that, youâll also need to import all variables that ModuleB references. Hence, even if your bubble only needs to call one external module directly, you may need to import a number of modules and variables in order to be able to use that one module.",

        "description": "Required. Any text expression giving the format of how the values (Vn parameters) are to be read. This format is similar, but not identical, to the C language format string for the scanf function, whereby each of the % format specifications assigns a value to one of the Vn parameters in the statement in the order in which each appears in the list. Note that like a standard text string, these format specifiers must also be enclosed by double quotes. If a format specification appears for which there are no remaining V parameters, the format specification value is read and discarded. For the % format specifications, the following form applies (where the [ ] indicates optional elements): %[*][width]type Whereâ¦ % Is a mandatory character * The optional asterisk     causes the read to occur as per the format specification, but suppresses any assignment to the Vn parameters. width Width is optional, specifying the maximum number of characters to read. type The specifications for type are listed in the following table: Format strings are case insensitive. Additionally, specifying a character for a type that is not in this list results in all the characters following the % up to that point to be read exactly as they appear in the Format string and discarded. Type Meaning Nb Binary format, where n is a number indicating the type of value (see below) c Single ASCII character (byte) d Signed decimal 64-bit integer e Signed exponential f Signed floating point g e or f formats i Signed decimal integer l Line of characters terminated by a carriage return, line feed, or both n Present offset in the buffer o Signed octal, 32-bit default* s Text string t Counted string u Unsigned decimal 64-bit integer x Signed hex integer using \"abcdef\", 32-bit default* znnn Escape character where nnn is the 3-digit ASCII code %x and %o will treat values as 32-bit integers by default unless the %ll modifier is used. %llx and %llo will read values in 64-bit. for %u, when reading an unsigned 64bit integer greater than 9223372036854775807 (the largest signed 64bit integer), the value will be read in as the bit-equivalent signed 64bit integer. ( eg. 9223372036854775808 is read in as -9223372036854775808.) nb, Binary type For the format specification of %nb, where n specifies the type of number, n must be a single digit from one of the following choices. All are low-byte-first. n value Type 0 Byte 1 Short integer (2 bytes, low byte first) 2 Long integer (4 bytes, low bytes first) 3 IEEE single precision float (4 bytes) 4 <obsolete> 5 IEEE double precision float (8 bytes) 6 <obsolete> 7 Binary unsigned short (2 bytes, low byte first) 8 Unsigned 32-bit integer 9 64-bit FileTime. This reads or writes a 64 bit time value in the Microsoft FileTime format.  When reading, the value is converted from the FileTime epoch and units (100 nanosecond intervals since Jan 1, 1601) to the VTS epoch and units (seconds since 1/1/1970) any times earlier than this will result in a value of 0.  When writing, the value is converted from the VTS epoch and units to the FileTime epoch and units. c,  ASCII character type :  Unlike BuffWrite this type deals with characters in a string; each character being equal to one byte. Unlike the %s option, which reads only up to the first white-space character, the %c option reads the number of characters/bytes specified by its width and is not terminated by any particular character. If no width is specified, a single character is read. d,  Signed decimal integer e,  Signed exponential f,  Signed floating point g,  e or f formats i,  Signed decimal integer type: This option normally reads a decimal integer; however, if a leading \"0b\" is encountered, the number will be interpreted as binary. If a leading \"0\" (zero only) is encountered, the number will be interpreted as octal. If a leading \"0x\" is encountered, the number will be interpreted as hexadecimal. For decimal, values will be read as 64-bit integers, but hex, octal and binary will be treated as 32-bit integers unless the %lli modifier is used, which will cause the %i format to treat hex, octal and binary as 64-bit. l,  Line of characters: This option reads a line of characters terminated by a carriage return, a line feed, or both (in either order). The carriage return and line feed will be discarded, and the next character read will be the first character on the next line. The maximum number of characters read is 2GiB (2^30 bytes) or less if the width option is used. n,  Buffer offset :  This option does not read a value, but returns the present offset in Buffer and can be useful in subsequent reads. o,  Unsigned Octal s,  Text string type: Text in the string is read up until a white-space character is encountered, or the specified width has been read, whichever is smaller. Square brackets enclosing a character, group of characters, or a caret and a group of characters used in the format string reads strings not delimited by spaces. This is a substitute for the %s format specification. The input is read up to the first character that does not appear inside the square brackets (note that this is case-sensitive). A dash may be used to specify a range of characters. For example, the following format specifier: % [A-Fa-f] will read a string up to the first which is not an A, B, C, D, E, or F both upper and lower case. t, Counted string type A counted string is encoded as a sequence of UTF-8 characters without a null terminator and preceded by the length in bytes. The length in bytes is encoded as Int32, i.e. a \"%2b\". A value of â1 is used to indicate an invalid string, a value of 0 indicates a null (\"\") string. Do not apply width or precision modifiers to a \"%t\" counted string. The caret symbol ^. If the first character inside the square brackets is a caret ( ^ ), the read progresses up to, but not including, the first character that appears inside the square brackets: %[^X-Z] This would read a string up to, but not including, the first X, Y or Z (upper-case only); if the string were terminated by an X, the next character read would be that X. Inside the square brackets, the backslash is used as an escape character - any character following a backslash (such as a caret, dash, or backslash) is taken as that character without special meaning. For example: %[^X-Z\\^] would behave as described previously, except that the string would now be read up to but not including the first X, Y, Z, or ^. Because format specifications for the Vn parameters are indicated by a percentage sign, to read (and discard) an actual percentage sign as part of the text string, precede it with a backslash character (i.e. \\%). Also, since the backslash character is used in this manner, as well as with special control characters such as line feed, carriage return and form feed, to read and discard a backslash, use two backslash characters (i.e. \\\\). x, Hexadecimal characters: the %x option reads the number of characters/bytes specified by its width and is not terminated by any particular character. If no width is specified, it will continue reading all bytes that can be recognized as hexadecimal characters. For example, given the string \"â¦= 3D\",  %[^=]=%2x  would read the hedadecimal value, 3D (decimal value, 61). znnn,   Escape characters: This specifies an escape character that will be thrown away when read, where nnn is a 3-digit number giving the ASCII character code of the escape character. This option is generally used as the sole format specifier that reads an entire string, spaces included, discarding every single occurrence of an escape character, or the first occurrence of every pair of escape characters. For example, if the string to be read looked like: abXc dXXfghiXXXjXXXXkl mX Xn o and the format specifier indicated that the ASCII code for 'X' (88) was to be the escape code: %25z088 then the variable that this was read into would contain: abc dXfghiXjXXkl m n o Notice that for each occurrence of X, the character immediately following it is saved, even if it is itself an escape character. Then the next occurrence of the escape character is discarded, with the character following it being saved, regardless of what it is, and so on. The width field specifies the maximum number of bytes to place in the output string; if this number is smaller than the input string (less the offending escape characters), the string will be truncated. If no width is specified, a single character will be read. Control characters: In order to encode certain control characters as part of the Format parameter, one of two methods may be used. The first is to use a backslash character followed by one of the single character codes listed below to produce the desired result. Please note that the letters must be lower case. Code Meaning \\b Backspace \\f Form Feed \\n Line Feed \\r Carriage Return \\t Horizontal Tab \\v Vertical Tab In addition to the predefined codes, an alternate form may be used: \\nnn: where nnn is a three digit integer in the range of 0 to 255 specifying a certain ASCII character. If the number contains less than three digits, the leading spaces must be padded with zeroes; this is not the case with the previously listed single character control characters. For example, to include the one byte ASCII character G in the output, you could place its decimal equivalent of 71 in the Format string as \\071."

      },
      {
        "name": "Format",
        "description": "Required. Any text expression giving the format of how the values (Vn parameters) are to be written. This format is similar, but not identical, to the C language format string for the printf function, whereby each of the Vn parameters in the statement is assigned to a % format specification in the order in which each appears in the list. Note that like a standard text string, these format specifiers must also be enclosed by double quotes. If a format specification appears for which there are no remaining V parameters, the format specification characters themselves are output to the stream exactly as they appear in the Format. For the % format specifications, the following form applies (where the [ ] indicates optional elements): %[-][+][SPACE][#][width][.precision]type where % (percent sign) is mandatory; -  (minus sign) (optional) causes the data to be left justified within the field (for binary types b and ASCII character types c, this option is ignored); + (plus sign) (optional) causes positive numbers to be prefaced with a + sign (negative numbers are unaffected). This allows easy alignment of positive and negative numbers in a printed column of numbers. For binary types b and non-numerical types, this option is ignored; space represents the single space character, and is similar to the [ + ] option but places a single space rather than a plus sign in front of positive numbers (negative numbers are still unaffected). This allows alignment of a column of numbers without having to show all signs. For binary types b and non-numerical types, this option is ignored; # (hash mark) When used with the o , x , or X format, the # flag prefixes any nonzero output value with 0, 0x, or 0X, respectively. width is a number that specifies the minimum number of characters to output. Numbers that require more characters than specified by the width value are truncated on output. If the number of characters in the number or string is less than width, blanks will be added to the left or right, depending upon whether the output is left or right justified (i.e. whether the [ - ] option has been specified) until the width is reached. For binary types b and ASCII character types c, this option is ignored; precision has a different meaning for each of the type options as follows: Integer types d, l, u, o, x, and X precision specifies the minimum number of digits to output. If the number contains fewer digits, leading zeroes will be added to the left of the number. If precision is 0, omitted, or if the decimal point appears without a number following it, the precision defaults to 1. The number is not truncated. Floating point types e and E precision specifies the number of digits after the decimal point. The last digit is rounded. The default precision in this case is 6. If the precision is 0 or if the decimal point appears without a number following it, no decimal point appears in the output. Floating point type f precision specifies the number of digits after the decimal point. The last digit is rounded. The default precision is 0. If the precision is explicitly 0, no decimal point is output. If a decimal point is output, at least one digit will be placed before the decimal point. Floating point types g and G precision specifies the maximum number of significant digits to be output. If no precision is specified, all significant digits are written. String type s precision specifies the maximum number of characters of the string to be output. If the string contains more characters than specified by the precision, the string is truncated and only the first characters are written. If the precision is not specified, all of the string characters are output. Byte type c  The precision option is ignored. Binary type b  The precision option is ignored. type is mandatory. The type specification must be one of those listed below. Note: The case of the letter is important. Specifying a character for the type that is not in this list will result in all the characters following the % up to that point to be output exactly as they appear in the Format string. Type Meaning nb Binary format; where n is a number indicating the type of value (see below). c Single character (byte values from 0 to 255) d Signed decimal 64-bit integer, 64-bit output by default e Signed exponential; exponent key is \"e\". E Signed exponential; exponent key is \"E\". f Signed floating point. g e or f format, whichever is shorter. G E or f format, whichever is shorter. h Handle to a window. i Signed decimal 64-bit integer, 64-bit output by default o Unsigned octal integer. Default 32-bit integer. Use %llo to output 64-bit value. p Pointer to a buffer. s Text string. t Writes a utf-8 string as used by OPC UA binary TCP: a 32-bit signed count of the length (-1 for an invalid string, 0 for an empty string), then the string u Unsigned decimal 64-bit integer, 64-bit output by default x Unsigned hex integer using \"abcdef\". Default 32-bit integer. (See following note.) X Unsigned hex integer using \"ABCDEF\". Default 32-bit integer. (See following note.) When writing negative values using either x or X format codes, the output will use a minimum of 32 bits because that is the smallest possible size to display the full information. Defining a format string such as \"%4X\" will not reduce this to 16 bit output for negative values. To output 64-bit values, use the modifier ll. %llx and %llX output 64-bit values. nb ,  Binary type  For the format specification of %nb, where n specifies the type of number, n must be a single digit from one of the following choices. All are low-byte-first. n Value Type 0 Byte, unsigned 1 Signed short integer (2 bytes) 2 Signed long integer (4 bytes) 3 IEEE single precision float (4 bytes) 4 <obsolete> 5 IEEE double precision float (8 bytes) 6 <obsolete> 7 Unsigned short integer (2 bytes) 8 Unsigned long integer (4 bytes) 9 Writes a time in Microsoft FILETIME format, which contains a 64-bit value representing the number of 100-nanosecond intervals since January 1, 1601 (UTC). 10 Outputs signed 64-bit integers in binary form. Note: Other options such as width and precision do not apply to the b type. c ,  Byte type:  This type is not representative of a single character in a string, but rather, represents single bytes. Input values (the Vn parameter to which this format specification applies) must be integers in the range of 0 to 255. Strings are not acceptable input values. Note that the %c format specifier behaves differently when used in an output statement such as BuffWrite than when used in an input statement, such as BuffRead. Some UTF-8 characters can require multiple bytes. Values from 0-127 are consistent between the traditional ASCII encoding and the UTF-8 encoding. d ,  Signed decimal 64-bit integer: e ,  Signed exponential:  Exponent key is \"e\" E ,  Signed exponential:  Exponent key is \"E\" f ,   Signed floating point g ,  e or f formats:  Whichever is shorter G,  E or F formats :  Whichever is shorter h ,  Window handle type:  This type is used for building structures to be handed to DLLs and should be used by advanced users only. p ,  Buffer pointer type:  This type is also used for building structures to be handed to DLLs and should be used by advanced users only. s ,  Text string type: t ,  Writes a utf-8 string as used by OPC UA binary TCP: a 32-bit signed count of the length (-1 for an invalid string, 0 for an empty string), then the string u ,  Unsigned decimal 64-bit integer, x ,  Unsigned hex integer using \"abcdef\": 32-bit value by default. Use modifier %llx for 64-bit value output. X ,  Unsigned hex integer using \"ABCDEF\": 32-bit value by default. Use modifier %llX for 64-bit value output. SWrite(Strm, \"%z92\",  \"Something \\to\\ be escaped\"); Gives the output:  Something \\\\to\\\\ be escaped Plain text Text in the Format parameter is written exactly as it appears, with three exceptions: Percentage sign (%)  Because format specifications for the Vn parameters are indicated by a percentage sign, to include an actual percentage sign as part of the Format parameter, precede it with a backslash character (i.e. \\%). Backslash character (\\)  Because this is used to indicate special control characters such as line feed, carriage return, and form feed, to write a backslash as part of the Format parameter, use two backslash characters (i.e. \\\\). Quotation marks (\")  The entire test string is delimited by quotation marks, so to include a set of quotation marks as part of the Format parameter, use a set of quotations marks (i.e. \"\"). Control characters In order to encode certain control characters as part of the Format parameter, one of two methods may be used. The first is to use a backslash character followed by one of the single character codes listed below to produce the desired result (notice that the letters must be lower case): Code Meaning \\b Backspace \\f Form feed \\n Line feed \\r Carriage return \\t Horizontal tab \\v Vertical tab \\nnn In addition to the above predefined codes, \\nnn may be used, where nnn is a three digit integer in the range of 0 to 255 specifying a certain ASCII character. If the number contains less than three digits, the leading spaces must be padded with zeroes; this is not the case with the previously listed single character control characters. For example, to include the one byte ASCII character G in the output, you could place its decimal equivalent of 71 in the Format string as \\071. znnn Escape character where nnn is the 3-digit ASCII code For example: SWrite(Strm, \"%z92\",  \"Something \\to\\ be escaped\"); Gives the output:  Something \\\\to\\\\ be escaped Offset is any numeric expression giving the starting buffer position in  bytes for the write, starting at 0."

It is the recommended method for combining different change paths against standard VTScada file types (settings files, source files, tag files, etc.). Changes from the high priority diff are treated preferentially to changes from the low priority diff when resolving conflicts. If the operation fails then the result will be the original buffer modified by the high priority diff only. Failure is indicated by the pFail parameter being set to a non-zero value that is typically a string detailing the type of failure. Notes: All Tag file conflicts are resolvable, Combine does not fails on tags. Conflicts of Adjacency (where two change regions share an edge but do not overlap) are resolved for all non-tag files. Simultaneous Addition Conflicts (where two pure addition changes coincide) are resolved for Page, Menu, Setting, and PageNote files. Specific segments of AppRoot files are parsed and rebuilt allowing for all types of conflicts to be resolved, these are additionally checked for duplicate entries, which are removed. The results of conflict resolution are passed to the Mend function to generate complete merged file buffers. This module returns a simple merge of the high priority diff and the source buffer should conflicts occur and conflict resolution fail. In this case *pFail is set to an error string that describes the failure in a human-readable form.",

    "comments": "COMClient instantiates a COM object. Generally this statement is used to instantiate COM objects that do not possess a user interface. If the object does display a user interface, then the user interface will appear in a window created and owned by the object. It is more usual to use the ActiveX statement to create a COM object that has a user interface. If the statement succeeds, a COM client interface is returned, allowing subsequent access to the object. If the statement fails, Invalid is returned. Arrays indexes are deliberately offset by -1 so that a 1-based array in the object becomes a 0-based array in script. EventSearchScope specifies the location where the event subroutines for this COM object instance may be found. Each event subroutine is named after the corresponding event produced by the default outgoing interface for the COM object. If the COM object generates an event for which an event subroutine cannot be found, the COM object is informed that event handling for that event is not implemented. When an event subroutine is run in response to an incoming event from the object, the parent and caller for the subroutine are as specified by EventParent and EventCaller. The event subroutine may update any of its parameters, and any that are defined as [in, out] or [out]. These will be returned to the COM object on completion of the event subroutine. The event subroutine should return an integer value, which is returned to the COM object as the result of the event. A value of 0 indicates the event completed successfully. If the COM object to be instantiated is an inproc server object (i.e. it is a DLL) then it must be a 64-bit COM server for 64-bit VTScada and a 32-bit COM server for 32-bit VTScada. If it is instantiated out-of-process (i.e. it is an .EXE) then either 32-bit VTScada or 64-bit VTScada can work with either 32-bit or 64-bit COM servers. If used in a script, the COM object will remain instantiated until the last reference to that object has been invalidated. You assign the return value of the COMClient script statement to a variable, and the COM object will remain instantiated as long as that variable or any other variable holds a copy of the COM Client Interface handle. Only when the last copy of the COM Client Interface handle has been destroyed will the COM object be destroyed. If used in a steady-state statement, the COM object will only remain instantiated while the steady-state statement is still running. In other words, a change of state or destruction of the module instance that is running the statement will cause the COM object to be destroyed. Any variables that hold a handle to the COM Client Interface will be invalidated at that time.",

Note that the return value only signals completion of the function's execution if it is true, otherwise the function will continue executing in the thread created for it. Because the value of the Stream parameter is created from a database, the DBSystem statement that created the database had to have a valid first parameter (the file name in which the database contents are stored). Do not attempt to access the database file directly via a FileStream statement if any DBSystem functions referencing this file are active, since the results may be unpredictable.

This is useful for ignoring \"noise\" in values such as analog inputs. Because VTScada performs calculations based upon changes in values, this function may be used in certain situations to minimize the number of irrelevant value changes and thereby reduce the frequency of calculations and improve performance. This function may also be used by PID to eliminate noise in the process value parameter and therefore avoid making frequent minor output changes which are irrelevant.

The DEFLATE algorithm is a dictionary-based compression technique, suitable for many types of data. A dictionary-based algorithm needs to include dictionary tokens in the output buffer, so compression of small buffers can give poor results. The DeflateHandle parameter is an opaque quantity that identifies an existing dictionary, or, if the variable it identifies does not hold an existing deflate handle, is set to a new deflate handle on return from the statement. Supplying the same deflate handle for successive calls to Deflate results in the existing dictionary being used and augmented on successive calls. This usually improves compression significantly. If you make a series of calls to Deflate, using the same deflate handle to decompress, then you must make a series of calls in the same sequence, with the initial call obtaining a new deflate handle, and subsequent calls using the newly-acquired deflate handle (see the \"Example\" section  for further details). MaxDecompressedLength is useful when you already know the size of the decompressed data (usually because you recorded it before compression was performed). While this parameter is not necessary, its use reduces the memory required to decompress the data. The default size of MaxDecompressedLength is 65536 bytes. Expanding data larger than this size will cause the output to be clipped unless a larger value is provided in this parameter.",

The contents of the value addressed by PtrReturnCode is undefined until the method returns Invalid. A single account can be deleted by supplying a single AccountData structure in NewAccountData. Multiple accounts can be deleted in one operation by providing a single dimension array or dictionary of AccountData structures in NewAccountData. The result code returned in the value addressed by PtrReturnCode will be a scalar value if a single structure was supplied in NewAccountData. If an array of structures or a dictionary of structures was supplied, a single dimension array of the same size as NewAccountData will be returned in the value addressed by PtrReturnCode, each element containing the result code for the corresponding NewAccountData element. Deleting an account requires a working copy write lock. If such a lock is held by the calling code, the HaveLock parameter must be set to TRUE. Otherwise omit this parameter or set it to FALSE. If the calling code holds a read lock on the working copy, this must be released before DeleteAccount can complete its operation.

The second word, taken as a 32-bit unsigned integer, indicates the offset of the operation. That is the location of the bytes affected. If the operation is to add bytes, there will be a binary string following the second word. These are the bytes to be added at the specified location. Because the diff function uses a searching algorithm, and in particular an incomplete search (that is it tries to find a solution without exploring all of the possibilities), it will at any time only have a partial collection of all the possible solutions to the problem. Each solution is defined as a set of instructions that modify the source buffer, and each of these sets requires a different number of instructions to convert a different region of that buffer. The \"best set\" is the one that converts the largest portion of the buffer while requiring the fewest changes to it, selected from the solutions that have been discovered so far. The optimization works by eliminating solutions which appear to be so much worse than the current best set that they are unlikely to recover, as judged by how many more changes they require to convert a similar region. The problem is that a solution which works poorly in one region may perform much better in the others, so the optimization may cause the \"real\" best set (the one that's optimal for the entire buffer) to be overlooked.

    "comments": "This function uses a callback system to acquire a set of changes against the repository tip versions of a file or group of files (both the local and deployed versions) and then applies those changes directly to the local and deployed repository tips without altering the working copy. The changes are then applied to the working copy as a result of the repository update. The primary purpose of this operation is to allow changes to a file to be deployed without also deploying any existing local changes to the same file. The local version must also be updated such that the file is updated correctly when the current local and deployed tips differ - otherwise conflicts could result when the repository attempts to rationalize the two. DirectApply is used to distribute operation changes, notes, security information, and other data for which it is not appropriate that one machine may be configured differently than its peers. It should not be used for normal configuration changes. To make all configuration changes deploy immediately set the \"Automatically Deploy\" flag in the CM Information panel. The callback definition follows: Callback (\r\n   DeployChangeSet   { Set of deploy buffers, make changes to these  };     \r\n   LocalChangeSet    { Set of local buffers, make changes to these   };\r\n   RSema             { Repo semaphore                                };\r\n   pComment          { Comment pointer allowing late editing         };\r\n) This module launches a worker module into the Layer so that the operation is not interrupted by this module's caller being slain.   In the case that the current machine is not  supporting an open local branch the LocalChangeSet callback parameter will be invalid.",

The second element, real N/2, is the last real component because real 0 and real N/2 are always real (no imaginary component). Real 1 is the real amplitude of the lowest frequency, and imaginary 1 is the imaginary amplitude of the lowest frequency. Real N/2-1 and imaginary N/2-1 are the real and imaginary components of the second highest frequency. The order of amplitude/phase pairs in Array is: amplitude 0, amplitude 1, ..., amplitude N/2, phase 1, phase 2, ..., phase N/2 - 1 Amplitude 0 is the average (D.C.) component in the signal. Amplitude 1 is the amplitude of the lowest frequency, amplitude N/2 is the amplitude of the highest frequency. Phase 1 is the phase angle (in radians) of the lowest frequency (the average doesn't have a phase, its frequency is 0). Phase N/2-1 is the phase angle of the second highest frequency. Note that neither the average (D.C.) component nor the highest frequency have a phase angle or imaginary component. The highest frequency and the sampling is: fc = 1/2Î Where fc is the critical (highest) frequency in Hertz, and Î is the sampling interval in seconds. The lowest frequency, the number of samples, and the sampling interval are related by the following equation: fL = 1/NÎ Where fL is the lowest frequency in Hertz, N is the number of samples, and Î is the sampling interval in seconds. All other frequencies are multiplies of the lowest frequency fL. Caution should be taken, as when VTScada executes a script, no other statements are updated.

    "comments": "This statement displays a threaded system dialog box for opening or saving a file, depending on the value of the Save parameter, however, it does not actually perform the requested action, but simply displays the dialog. If successful, the Result parameter will be set to the full path and file name of the chosen file, or 0 if it fails or is canceled. It is the user's responsibility to act upon the value of Result and save or open the file by using such commands as FWrite or FRead. In addition to the Result parameter, the function itself will return an error code to indicate whether the dialog was successfully opened. A \"1\" indicates failure to open while a \"0\" indicates success. The Directory parameter is ignored for Open and Save operations if the File parameter contains a path. You can use this feature to define the initial directory, but return to the  selected file if the user re-opens the dialog. For example: FileDialogBox(1, \"\", \"\", SelectedFile, InitialDirectory, ....); SelectedFile can be initialized to \"SomeFile.txt\", in which case the InitialDirectory will be used. After the user has selected a file (\"C:\\AnotherFile.txt\") , and reopens the dialog, then it will reopen to the path in SelectedFile. This avoids having to parse a user selection result (SelectedFile) into a filename and path to achieve the same effect. For Save -1 (directory browser mode) the Directory parameter means something different. Directory defines the root of the selectable directories. For example, you can use this feature to restrict the user from selecting a directory outside their VTScada application folder. Passing the VTScada application path as Directory, means that operators would only be able to select that folder, or any sub-folders. This option can be used in conjunction with 'File' to restrict the selectable path and also have an initial selection. If either the FilterPattern or FilterDesc parameters use dynamically allocated arrays (i.e. created using the New function), the dialog box will not open - these two parameters must use statically declared arrays. If using a single text value instead, you may specify as many wildcard patterns as needed by adding a semi-colon separator between each: \"*.BMP;*.JPG;*.PNG;*.TIF\". If the Save parameter is a negative value, indicating that a \"Browse for Folder\" dialog is required, the Directory and Title parameters must be set. Title will be displayed above the tree view control in the dialog box. This string can be used to specify instructions to the user. Directory can either be a string containing the starting root directory to begin browsing, or a CSIDL value to specify a special folder (a CSIDL is a number, the definitions of which can be found in the Platform SDK). The remaining parameters may be set to any valid value, including empty strings (\"\"). FTP sites may not be browsed depending if the server is running an older Windows operating system.

    "comments": "The operation is bound to the speed of the physical media and can be slow. This function is used to ensure that all preceding operations on a FileStream have been completed on the physical media before the operation completes. All file operations in VTScada are subject to the mediation of the file cache (a part of the Operating System that serves to speed up file access) which can have a reliability cost when the cache or the media are disrupted. This function allows the caller to momentarily opt out of the file cache, ensuring that a file is in the expected state while exposing the caller to the performance limitations of the physical device. As this can be a very slow operation it is performed asynchronously, with the caller being informed after the operation completes. Note that an asynchronous flush can be prevented by the CloseStream function if that results in the file being closed before the flush completes. There are two types of asynchronous operation available, depending upon whether the CompletionCounter value has been set to a variable containing a valid or invalid value. If invalid, the thread upon which the call was made is blocked until the operation completes, but other threads are allowed to run. CompletionCounter should not be set invalid if Flush is called in a CriticalSection as this will cause all threads to await the flush operation. If CompletionCounter is set to a valid numeric value then the flush operation will occur independently of the calling thread, which will continue executing immediately. This mechanism is identical to that used by the Diff function, and the CompletionCounter parameters of the two operations can be shared. If the Success parameter is provided and has not been set to 1 by the time the operation completes then it should be assumed that the file has not been persisted, and in fact may not be persist-able. This can happen if there is something wrong with the Stream parameter, or if either the OS file cache or the physical media are damaged. Flushing a file that has nothing to write will set this parameter to TRUE (1).",

        "description": "Required. Any text expression giving the format of how the values (Vn parameters) are to be read. This format is similar, but not identical, to the C language format string for the scanf function, whereby each of the % format specifications assigns a value to one of the Vn parameters in the statement in the order in which each appears in the list. Note that like a standard text string, these format specifiers must also be enclosed by double quotes. If a format specification appears for which there are no remaining V parameters, the format specification value is read and discarded. For the % format specifications, the following form applies (where the [ ] indicates optional elements): %[*][width]type Whereâ¦ % Is a mandatory character * The optional asterisk     causes the read to occur as per the format specification, but suppresses any assignment to the Vn parameters. width Width is optional, specifying the maximum number of characters to read. type The specifications for type are listed in the following table: Format strings are case insensitive. Additionally, specifying a character for a type that is not in this list results in all the characters following the % up to that point to be read exactly as they appear in the Format string and discarded. Type Meaning Nb Binary format, where n is a number indicating the type of value (see below) c Single ASCII character (byte) d Signed decimal 64-bit integer e Signed exponential f Signed floating point g e or f formats i Signed decimal integer l Line of characters terminated by a carriage return, line feed, or both n Present offset in the buffer o Signed octal, 32-bit default* s Text string t Counted string u Unsigned decimal 64-bit integer x Signed hex integer using \"abcdef\", 32-bit default* znnn Escape character where nnn is the 3-digit ASCII code %x and %o will treat values as 32-bit integers by default unless the %ll modifier is used. %llx and %llo will read values in 64-bit. for %u, when reading an unsigned 64bit integer greater than 9223372036854775807 (the largest signed 64bit integer), the value will be read in as the bit-equivalent signed 64bit integer. ( eg. 9223372036854775808 is read in as -9223372036854775808.) nb, Binary type For the format specification of %nb, where n specifies the type of number, n must be a single digit from one of the following choices. All are low-byte-first. n value Type 0 Byte 1 Short integer (2 bytes, low byte first) 2 Long integer (4 bytes, low bytes first) 3 IEEE single precision float (4 bytes) 4 <obsolete> 5 IEEE double precision float (8 bytes) 6 <obsolete> 7 Binary unsigned short (2 bytes, low byte first) 8 Unsigned 32-bit integer 9 64-bit FileTime. This reads or writes a 64 bit time value in the Microsoft FileTime format.  When reading, the value is converted from the FileTime epoch and units (100 nanosecond intervals since Jan 1, 1601) to the VTS epoch and units (seconds since 1/1/1970) any times earlier than this will result in a value of 0.  When writing, the value is converted from the VTS epoch and units to the FileTime epoch and units. c,  ASCII character type :  Unlike BuffWrite this type deals with characters in a string; each character being equal to one byte. Unlike the %s option, which reads only up to the first white-space character, the %c option reads the number of characters/bytes specified by its width and is not terminated by any particular character. If no width is specified, a single character is read. d,  Signed decimal integer e,  Signed exponential f,  Signed floating point g,  e or f formats i,  Signed decimal integer type: This option normally reads a decimal integer; however, if a leading \"0b\" is encountered, the number will be interpreted as binary. If a leading \"0\" (zero only) is encountered, the number will be interpreted as octal. If a leading \"0x\" is encountered, the number will be interpreted as hexadecimal. For decimal, values will be read as 64-bit integers, but hex, octal and binary will be treated as 32-bit integers unless the %lli modifier is used, which will cause the %i format to treat hex, octal and binary as 64-bit. l,  Line of characters: This option reads a line of characters terminated by a carriage return, a line feed, or both (in either order). The carriage return and line feed will be discarded, and the next character read will be the first character on the next line. The maximum number of characters read is 2GiB (2^30 bytes) or less if the width option is used. n,  Buffer offset :  This option does not read a value, but returns the present offset in Buffer and can be useful in subsequent reads. o,  Unsigned Octal s,  Text string type: Text in the string is read up until a white-space character is encountered, or the specified width has been read, whichever is smaller. Square brackets enclosing a character, group of characters, or a caret and a group of characters used in the format string reads strings not delimited by spaces. This is a substitute for the %s format specification. The input is read up to the first character that does not appear inside the square brackets (note that this is case-sensitive). A dash may be used to specify a range of characters. For example, the following format specifier: % [A-Fa-f] will read a string up to the first which is not an A, B, C, D, E, or F both upper and lower case. t, Counted string type A counted string is encoded as a sequence of UTF-8 characters without a null terminator and preceded by the length in bytes. The length in bytes is encoded as Int32, i.e. a \"%2b\". A value of â1 is used to indicate an invalid string, a value of 0 indicates a null (\"\") string. Do not apply width or precision modifiers to a \"%t\" counted string. The caret symbol ^. If the first character inside the square brackets is a caret ( ^ ), the read progresses up to, but not including, the first character that appears inside the square brackets: %[^X-Z] This would read a string up to, but not including, the first X, Y or Z (upper-case only); if the string were terminated by an X, the next character read would be that X. Inside the square brackets, the backslash is used as an escape character - any character following a backslash (such as a caret, dash, or backslash) is taken as that character without special meaning. For example: %[^X-Z\\^] would behave as described previously, except that the string would now be read up to but not including the first X, Y, Z, or ^. Because format specifications for the Vn parameters are indicated by a percentage sign, to read (and discard) an actual percentage sign as part of the text string, precede it with a backslash character (i.e. \\%). Also, since the backslash character is used in this manner, as well as with special control characters such as line feed, carriage return and form feed, to read and discard a backslash, use two backslash characters (i.e. \\\\). x, Hexadecimal characters: the %x option reads the number of characters/bytes specified by its width and is not terminated by any particular character. If no width is specified, it will continue reading all bytes that can be recognized as hexadecimal characters. For example, given the string \"â¦= 3D\",  %[^=]=%2x  would read the hedadecimal value, 3D (decimal value, 61). znnn,   Escape characters: This specifies an escape character that will be thrown away when read, where nnn is a 3-digit number giving the ASCII character code of the escape character. This option is generally used as the sole format specifier that reads an entire string, spaces included, discarding every single occurrence of an escape character, or the first occurrence of every pair of escape characters. For example, if the string to be read looked like: abXc dXXfghiXXXjXXXXkl mX Xn o and the format specifier indicated that the ASCII code for 'X' (88) was to be the escape code: %25z088 then the variable that this was read into would contain: abc dXfghiXjXXkl m n o Notice that for each occurrence of X, the character immediately following it is saved, even if it is itself an escape character. Then the next occurrence of the escape character is discarded, with the character following it being saved, regardless of what it is, and so on. The width field specifies the maximum number of bytes to place in the output string; if this number is smaller than the input string (less the offending escape characters), the string will be truncated. If no width is specified, a single character will be read. Control characters: In order to encode certain control characters as part of the Format parameter, one of two methods may be used. The first is to use a backslash character followed by one of the single character codes listed below to produce the desired result. Please note that the letters must be lower case. Code Meaning \\b Backspace \\f Form Feed \\n Line Feed \\r Carriage Return \\t Horizontal Tab \\v Vertical Tab In addition to the predefined codes, an alternate form may be used: \\nnn: where nnn is a three digit integer in the range of 0 to 255 specifying a certain ASCII character. If the number contains less than three digits, the leading spaces must be padded with zeroes; this is not the case with the previously listed single character control characters. For example, to include the one byte ASCII character G in the output, you could place its decimal equivalent of 71 in the Format string as \\071."

Note that Array will not be initially invalidated upon execution of this statement, so if Array already contained data when the GetHistory was executed, that data will remain untouched until all of the data requested by GetHistory has been amassed, at which time Array will be set to its new value. Because Array could conceivably remain invalid indefinitely (i.e. there was no data in the requested time span), Error will always be set to a valid value to indicate completion of execution. There is a return value for this function that indicates if any of its parameters are invalid. The function will immediately return a value of false (0) unless a parameter was invalid, in which case it will return true (1). Note that the return value only signals completion of the function's execution if it is true, otherwise the function will continue executing in its thread. If PathPrefix is specified, then this changes the interpretation of the File parameter. In this case, the referenced file is not the source of the data, but a file containing references to other files which are the data sources. This file should be in standard VTScada log file format and should contain a file reference as the first text value of each record (other values are ignored). The records should be in the correct time order with respect to the data files. The value of the PathPrefix is a string, which when prefixed to one of the file references, will yield a full pathname to the target file. If no prefix is required, but expansion of the dataset is required, then PathPrefix should be an empty string. If a filename entry does NOT begin with a \"\\\" or \"<drive letter>:\\\", then the PathPrefix will be prepended to the filename. If a filename entry DOES begin with \"<drive letter>:\\\", then the PathPrefix will NOT be prepended to the filename. If a filename entry does begin with a \"\\\", then the \"<drive letter>:\" from the PathPrefix will be prepended to the filename.

Equivalent to mode 4. 11 Difference between the start and end values of a range (see following note) 12 Bitwise OR (see following note) 13 Bitwise AND (see following note) 14 Value at end of range Mode 11: This is for hardware that can count to a limited number, then rolls over to start a fresh count. For example, a tag that counts equipment starts, but which can only count from 0 to 15  before wrapping around to start again. This gives a value of sixteen per roll-over since there must be one more start after fifteen to have the roll-over occur. A graph of a very simple case where there is a start every second would look like the following: (Each rollover must be followed by a fresh start, not a gradually declining value. If there are a series of declining values then, because each is less than the previous, each counts as another rollover.) The formula used is (RolloverCount * RolloverValue) + (LastValidValue - FirstValidValue). Where, for any given time interval: Rollovers are counted when a new value is smaller than the last valid value. The RolloverValue is passed to the function in the parameter StaleTime. LastValidValue starts with the last valid value in the previous time interval (if any), and is updated with each new valid value within the time interval. FirstValidValue starts with the last valid value in the previous time interval (if any), and is updated with only the first valid value found in the current time span. Given this example, suppose that you want a count of starts in each thirty-second interval. In the first interval there is no previous valid value, one wrap-around and a last valid value of 12. (1*16) + (12 - 0) = 28. This is an idealized case. Consider a more realistic case where not all values are logged. (This may be due to factors such as polling intervals, deadbands, hardware, etc.) The following graph shows the same data where the orange dots represent values obtained and logged and the gray line represents what really happened: In the first 30 seconds there is one roll-over when the value drops from 13 to 2. The first value is 0 and the last is 11. The Historian will return 27: (1*16) + (11-0) = 27. The Historian will return 30 for the period from 30 to 60. The first valid value (carried from the previous period) is 11. The last valid value is 9 and there are two roll-overs. (2*16) + (9-11) = 30. Modes 12 and 13: These are intended to provide a summary of the bit-wise Historian value attributes within a query. (Value attributes were added in VTScada version 11.5 / 12.0) With mode 12, the first value is OR'd with zero, and each successive value in the time period is OR'd with result of the last comparison. From the result you will know whether any particular attribute bit was set on any values within the period. With mode 13, the first value is AND'd with a value having all bits set to 1 and each successive value is AND'd with the result of the last comparison. From the result you will know whether any particular attribute bit was set on all values within the period."

A module reference box, or MRB as it is sometimes called, is not a clipping region and objects can and often will extend outside of their MRB as a result of applied rotations or trajectories. When a module is transformed, the transform is based on the size of the module as determined by its reference box. The module's reference box will always exactly fill the reference box of the transform. In the case of graphics that have had a rotation or trajectory applied to them, the graphics will be transformed correctly, but the MRB may no longer contain the objects in their modified positions. If a SetModuleRefBox has been done within the module in question, or its module reference box has been defined by following the module name with the four boundaries enclosed in parentheses, the return value will be based on these explicitly defined boundaries. Otherwise the return value will define the minimum reference box that will exactly enclose all (GUI) graphics in the module. This does not include any child graphics (i.e. graphics created by child modules of Module). Module does not need to be running at the time that this statement is called to retrieve valid data.",

If working with parameterized phrases, \\GetParmPhrase may be preferred in order to avoid the effort of assembling a ParmPhrase structure, which can be built only in Script. When called in the context of a user session (e.g. from user-interface code such as a page), the phrase will be returned in the user's currently selected language. Otherwise, the phrase will be returned in the application's default language as specified in the Languages panel of the Application Configuration dialog. As a specialized use-case, GetPhrase also supports the use of translation dictionaries. Use the following information only in the rare case that a standard .csv file of static translations is not suitable. Translation dictionaries should take the following form, which is used in place of the PhraseKey parameter: System.MakeDictionary(\"en\", \"hello\", \"fr\", \"bonjour\", \"es\", \"hola\"); GetPhrase will then return the translation corresponding to the user's current language. If the dictionary does not include a translation for the user's current language but does for the default language, then the default will be returned. If that also does not exist, then return \"Missing translation\" (language dependent). Note that the phrase may not update dynamically when the content for a given key in the dictionary changes. Translation dictionaries should not be used in most applications.",

If GetServerChanges() is instead written as a launched module that slays itself when complete, the RPC thread will continue to service other RPC requests while you are building your synchronization data package. Further, if GetServerChanges() is written as a subroutine, the RPC thread can be suspended while running your GetServerChanges() script, allowing your service thread to get a time slice and modify the service data that you are attempting to sample. This may cause two PCs running the same service to end up with mismatching data. You must write GetServerChanges() as a launched module and call \\RPCManager.SetDivert() as soon as you have finished sampling the synchronizable data for your service. If there is any possibility that another execution thread in your application can modify the data that GetServerChanges() is sampling during building of the synchronization package, you must protect the acquisition of the synchronization package with a CriticalSection().",

Equivalent to mode 4. 11 Difference between the start and end values of a range (see following note) 12 Bitwise OR (see following note) 13 Bitwise AND (see following note) 14 Value at end of range Mode 11: This is for hardware that can count to a limited number, then rolls over to start a fresh count. For example, a tag that counts equipment starts, but which can only count from 0 to 15  before wrapping around to start again. This gives a value of sixteen per roll-over since there must be one more start after fifteen to have the roll-over occur. A graph of a very simple case where there is a start every second would look like the following: (Each rollover must be followed by a fresh start, not a gradually declining value. If there are a series of declining values then, because each is less than the previous, each counts as another rollover.) The formula used is (RolloverCount * RolloverValue) + (LastValidValue - FirstValidValue). Where, for any given time interval: Rollovers are counted when a new value is smaller than the last valid value. The RolloverValue is passed to the function in the parameter StaleTime. LastValidValue starts with the last valid value in the previous time interval (if any), and is updated with each new valid value within the time interval. FirstValidValue starts with the last valid value in the previous time interval (if any), and is updated with only the first valid value found in the current time span. Given this example, suppose that you want a count of starts in each thirty-second interval. In the first interval there is no previous valid value, one wrap-around and a last valid value of 12. (1*16) + (12 - 0) = 28. This is an idealized case. Consider a more realistic case where not all values are logged. (This may be due to factors such as polling intervals, deadbands, hardware, etc.) The following graph shows the same data where the orange dots represent values obtained and logged and the gray line represents what really happened: In the first 30 seconds there is one roll-over when the value drops from 13 to 2. The first value is 0 and the last is 11. The Historian will return 27: (1*16) + (11-0) = 27. The Historian will return 30 for the period from 30 to 60. The first valid value (carried from the previous period) is 11. The last valid value is 9 and there are two roll-overs. (2*16) + (9-11) = 30. Modes 12 and 13: These are intended to provide a summary of the bit-wise Historian value attributes within a query. (Value attributes were added in VTScada version 11.5 / 12.0) With mode 12, the first value is OR'd with zero, and each successive value in the time period is OR'd with result of the last comparison. From the result you will know whether any particular attribute bit was set on any values within the period. With mode 13, the first value is AND'd with a value having all bits set to 1 and each successive value is AND'd with the result of the last comparison. From the result you will know whether any particular attribute bit was set on all values within the period. In the case of modes 5 and 6, FieldName should still be set to indicate the field on which the mode is to act. The return values will be times indicating the maximum or minimum in that field for each time span. If TPP is less than or equal to 0, Mode is ignored. If the data is text, the first entry in a given time range is used for the array entry and Mode is ignored. It is possible to retrieve more than one mode in a single GetTagHistory statement. To do this, pass an array of values in as the Mode parameter."

There is an explicit return code set when the function is complete, rather than just returning a single-element array when an error occurs, which is ambiguous to whether it indicates an error or returned data. Moreover, the array returned is always a two-dimensional array. Note: if multiple modes are being returned from the same field, the array size of fields needs to match that of mode.

    "comments": "GUIButtons drawn on a page cannot be modified using ribbons or properties dialogs. Editing can only be done in code. Standard practice is to use WinButtons if displaying plain text labels, and to use images for the labels when using a GUIButton. There are three basic types of buttons: Momentary Toggle (or latching) Radio (which is actually a group of buttons behaving as a unit) For details on how to create each of these types, see the Examples section. A momentary button is one that immediately releases when pressed (i.e. it does not remain in its pressed position). It is usually used in conjunction with an If statement as an action trigger for a script. A toggle or latching button is a button that when pressed remains locked (latched) into its pressed position until it is pressed again (unlatched). Its Variable parameter will be set according to the position of the button - if it is latched in (pressed), the variable will be set to 1, otherwise it will be 0. Similarly, if the variable's value is set by an external source from 0 to 1, the button will become pressed to match the value. This latching/toggling effect is achieved by the UpValue parameter being set to ! Variable, which is the same as saying \"not the value of the Variable parameter\" or more simply, \"toggle the value from what it  is\". A radio button is one of a set of latching buttons that are mutually exclusive, that is to say, only one button in the set may be latched (down) at one time. When another button in the same set is pressed, the current depressed button will \"pop out\". Two buttons cannot be latched in at once. If the FocusID parameter of a GUIButton is to be used in a NextFocusID statement to force this graphic to get the focus, it is important to note that this does not cause the GUIButton statement to become true (selected), but only for it to become focused. When the button is focused it may then be selected via the <CR> key on the keyboard. Because structures cannot be initialized in steady state, the ImageSet parameter must be created in a script. You may create your own structures, or use one that has been created for you. The syntax to use the predefined structure varies depending on whether you are working in a script application or a standard VTScada application. For script applications, use System.ImageSetStruct() For standard applications, use \\ImageSetStruct(). The following set of rules defines the ImageSet behavior... In the absence of the ImageSet parameter or, if that parameter is present but is not valid, the GUIButton statement will display a set of predefined renderings. In the presence of a valid ImageSet parameter, the current GUIButton rendering will be disabled. (Note that providing a valid variable that holds Invalid for this parameter will not disable the older GUIButton rendering). It is possible to specify the ImageSet parameter as Invalid and use only the  ClickSound parameter The ImageSet parameter, when valid, must consist of a structure holding the images. Each structure member must be named as described in the parameter listing above. The only valid formats for each image in the structure are image values. You may declare your own structure or use one of the pre-created structures in VTScada. For standard apps you can simply use \\ImageSetStruct ()and for script apps you can use System.ImageSetStruct() In addition to these rules for the ImageSet structure, the following rules govern how the button will be rendered: If no image is provided in the set, no images shall be displayed for the button. You will end up with a blank, click-able area If the button is disabled, the \"Disabled\" image will be displayed at all times. If there is no Disabled image the \"Up\" image will be displayed. If the mouse cursor is not within the bounding box of the button: If the button state is logically up, the \"Up\" image (if any) shall be displayed. If there is no \"Up\" image, no image shall be displayed. If the button state is logically down, the \"Down\" image (if any) shall be displayed. If there is no \"Down\" image, no image shall be displayed. If the mouse cursor is within the bounding box of the button: If the button state is logically up, the \"MouseOverUp\" image (if any) shall be displayed. If there is no \"MouseOverUp\" image, the \"Up\" image (if any) shall be displayed. If there is no \"Up\" image, no image shall be displayed. If the button state is logically down, the \"MouseOverDown\" image (if any) shall  be displayed. If there is no \"MouseOverDown\" image, the \"Down\" image (if any) shall be displayed. If there is no \"Down\" image, no image shall be displayed. If the mouse cursor is within the bounding box of the button: If the button state is logically up, the \"MouseOverUp\" image (if any) shall be displayed. If there is no \"MouseOverUp\" image, the \"Up\" image (if any) shall be displayed. If there is no \"Up\" image, no image shall be displayed. If the button state is logically down, the \"MouseOverDown\" image (if any) shall  be displayed. If there is no \"MouseOverDown\" image, the \"Down\" image (if any) shall be displayed. If there is no \"Down\" image, no image shall be displayed. The control has the ability to display text layered on top of the images. The text is displayed regardless of which image is being displayed. The text must be provided by the existing UpLabel, DownLabel, TextColor and Font parameters. If the UpLabel and DownLabel parameters are images, then they will not be used if the ImageSet parameter has prevented old GUIButton rendering. The following parameters do not affect how the new images are displayed: Brush,   HighlightPen,   ShadowPen,   Sides. This function is a layered graphics statement. See \"Use Scaling to Position GUI Objects\" for information about positioning a layered graphic. The Left and Right references are interchangeable. Whichever is smaller is taken as the left and the larger of the two values will be used as the right. The same is true of the top and bottom references. Note that the 1 st 42 pixels of a VTScada application will be obscured by the title bar, if present. Will not display tab characters.",

The same is true of the top and bottom references. Note that the 1 st 42 pixels of a VTScada application will be obscured by the title bar, if present. This is typically used to display a module which contains an active graphics symbol. The transformation is applied by finding the minimum area box which contains all reference box coordinates (the first 4) for all graphics active in that module. A scaling is performed on all graphics in that module to make them appear in the reference box specified in the transform. This is typically used to make a group of objects move and scale together. For example, a module (called PumpSymbol) could draw a symbol (such as a pump). By applying a transform to this module, it can be made to appear in a certain area of the screen. Any mouse functions contained by the transform will also be affected. For example, if the object is rotated 90 degrees XLoc will begin to behave like YLoc. A draggable GUITransform has two renderings. The palette rendering is what is displayed in the palette and is the image attached to the mouse at the start of dragging the transform onto a drop-target window. When the mouse cursor is moved over a drop-target window, the module called by the GUITransform is rendered at the native size of the called module and displayed in its place. The rendering is scaled according to the zoom factor of the drop-target window. Moving off the drop target window again displays the palette rendering. The relative mouse position within the graphic when the drag operation is started is maintained throughout the operation. Therefore, when the image switches from the palette rendering to the called module rendering, the mouse position within the called module rendering is over the same feature of the graphic as when the palette rendering is used.",

Equivalent to mode 4. 11 Difference between the start and end values of a range (see following note) 12 Bitwise OR (see following note) 13 Bitwise AND (see following note) 14 Value at end of range Mode 11: This is for hardware that can count to a limited number, then rolls over to start a fresh count. For example, a tag that counts equipment starts, but which can only count from 0 to 15  before wrapping around to start again. This gives a value of sixteen per roll-over since there must be one more start after fifteen to have the roll-over occur. A graph of a very simple case where there is a start every second would look like the following: (Each rollover must be followed by a fresh start, not a gradually declining value. If there are a series of declining values then, because each is less than the previous, each counts as another rollover.) The formula used is (RolloverCount * RolloverValue) + (LastValidValue - FirstValidValue). Where, for any given time interval: Rollovers are counted when a new value is smaller than the last valid value. The RolloverValue is passed to the function in the parameter StaleTime. LastValidValue starts with the last valid value in the previous time interval (if any), and is updated with each new valid value within the time interval. FirstValidValue starts with the last valid value in the previous time interval (if any), and is updated with only the first valid value found in the current time span. Given this example, suppose that you want a count of starts in each thirty-second interval. In the first interval there is no previous valid value, one wrap-around and a last valid value of 12. (1*16) + (12 - 0) = 28. This is an idealized case. Consider a more realistic case where not all values are logged. (This may be due to factors such as polling intervals, deadbands, hardware, etc.) The following graph shows the same data where the orange dots represent values obtained and logged and the gray line represents what really happened: In the first 30 seconds there is one roll-over when the value drops from 13 to 2. The first value is 0 and the last is 11. The Historian will return 27: (1*16) + (11-0) = 27. The Historian will return 30 for the period from 30 to 60. The first valid value (carried from the previous period) is 11. The last valid value is 9 and there are two roll-overs. (2*16) + (9-11) = 30. Modes 12 and 13: These are intended to provide a summary of the bit-wise Historian value attributes within a query. (Value attributes were added in VTScada version 11.5 / 12.0) With mode 12, the first value is OR'd with zero, and each successive value in the time period is OR'd with result of the last comparison. From the result you will know whether any particular attribute bit was set on any values within the period. With mode 13, the first value is AND'd with a value having all bits set to 1 and each successive value is AND'd with the result of the last comparison. From the result you will know whether any particular attribute bit was set on all values within the period. In the case of modes 5 and 6, FieldName should still be set to indicate the field on which the mode is to act. The return values will be times indicating the maximum or minimum in that field for each time span. If TPP is less than or equal to 0, Mode is ignored. If the data is text, the first entry in a given time range is used for the array entry and Mode is ignored. It is possible to retrieve more than one mode in a single GetTagHistory statement. To do this, pass an array of values in as the Mode parameter."

If the Value changes from invalid to valid, the new valid result will start at zero. This function is the inverse of Deriv. The time parameter is necessary because of VTScada's evaluation method of not doing any calculations unless necessitated by a change in a parameter. This means that if Value remains unchanged, the Intgr function will be re-calculated after the time interval specified by the Time parameter. This function is often used in control functions such as PID loops where it makes up the \"I\" in the \"PID.\" The Intgr function is reset when it appears in a true action trigger, when a state starts, or when it appears in a function which resets its parameters (e.g. Latch, Toggle, and Save). When Intgr is reset, the integral starts from zero again. This function does calculations with double-precision floating point values and does not support 64-bit integers computations.",

It is a launched module and so you should launch it and wait for completion (the object value returned from the launch statement goes Invalid). Failure to do so may result in not all data being written. LargeSocketWrite is more efficient if a stream is passed in the Source parameter - a text value is first converted to a BuffStream before writing and the BuffStream discarded after the write completes. If the Source Parameter is a stream, writing to the socket starts from the current position in the stream. The Source stream is not repositioned at the end of the write. Passing in a Stream parameter that is not a ClientSocket or ServerSocket stream does nothing and LargeSocketWrite will terminate quickly.",

    "comments": "You should do implicit launches when possible, noting that it is almost always possible. The only time you need to do an explicit launch is if you need the code to execute with a different parent or caller than it normally would. This use-case is quite specialized. This function returns an object value of the newly started module. In general, variables that are listed in the final parameter spots are passed to the module as a value only. This means that if the launched module instance changes the value of one of the parameters, its value will not change outside of the scope of the module. If a launched module contains a Return statement it is will run as a subroutine, whether it is explicitly or implicitly launched. This is true even if the Return statement is in a state that does not get executed. In that case, the script that launches the sub-routine will stop its execution indefinitely, waiting for the sub-routine to return a value. If \"myMod\" is a subroutine, then in the statement, x = Launch(\"myMod\", â¦); x will be set to the value returned by the subroutine's Return statement upon completion. Prior to execution of the Return statement, x will be invalid, unlike a module that is not a subroutine, which would set x to the object value of the launched module. A common syntactical problem with the use of the Launch function will result in two instances of a module running. The following example  shows the improper syntax [\r\n  X Module;\r\n  Y;\r\n]\r\nLaunch(X, Self, Self); (assuming that \"X\" is declared as a module.) The problem here is the first parameter. As written above, the code will launch a module called \"X\", and use the return value from the launch (an object value) as the first parameter for Launch . This will result in two copies of the \"X\" module running. If you copy the module value into Y (ie Y = \\X;), then Launch(Y, Self, Self) does not launch two copies. The correct syntax is: Launch(\"X\", Self, Self); Use care in how you write a Launch statement. For example: X = Launch(Scope(<variable>, \"Y\", TRUE)... If it is unknown whether Y exists in the module pointed to by <variable> or if in fact <variable> is valid, then setting the ScopeLocal parameter to TRUE as shown, may help to avoid undesirable results. In the rare case that the module being launched is a child module of the caller's module, and if there are variables external to the module that the module itself will be required to alter, it is best to make them within the scope of Parent.",
    "example": "  If !Valid(Obj);\r\n  [\r\n    Obj = Launch(\\DataLog,\r\n                 Self(), Self()  { Parent and caller },\r\n                 TimeSpan, FileSave { Parameters });\r\n  ]"

If no variables are found, the return value will be a valid pointer to an array with no elements. Data Handling in Statically-declared Arrays vs. Dynamically-allocated Arrays. ListVars handles data in statically declared arrays differently from data stored in dynamically allocated arrays. In the following example, two arrays have been declared. The first (A1) is statically-declared, while the second (A2) is dynamically-allocated. A1[2][3]; \r\nA2; \r\n\r\nA2 = New(2, 3); \r\nA1[0][0] = \"zerozero\"; \r\nA2[0][0] = \"zerozero\"; \r\nA1[1][0] = BuffStream(\"onezero\");\r\nA2[1][0] = BuffStream(\"onezero\"); \r\nA1[1][1] = 11; \r\nA2[1][1] = 11; \r\nA1[1][2] = 12;\r\nA2[1][2] = 12; \r\n\r\nAFiles = ListVars(Self(), \"A*\", 0, 65535 { class limits }, 0, 0 { all matches }, \r\n0 { local only }, 8 { ptr to variables }, 1 { sort }); To retrieve the value of each element in the statically-declared array named, \"A1\", you can use: ElemA1_00 = AFiles[0][0][0]; \r\nElemA1_10 = AFiles[0][1][0]; \r\nElemA1_11 = AFiles[0][1][1]; â¦ and so forth. However, this same call for the dynamically-allocated array named, \"A2\", will not retrieve the expected elements. Rather, the correct syntax for data retrieval in this case is: ElemA2_00 = (*AFiles[0])[0][0]; \r\nElemA2_10 = (*AFiles[0])[1][0]; \r\nElemA2_11 = (*AFiles[0])[1][1]; The data retrieval method displayed above for the dynamically-allocated array will also work for static arrays, thus it is recommended that this be the method used for general array data retrieval.",

The return value is either the Windowsâ¢ handle of the new DLL (ValueType == 38), or on failure, the least significant 16-bits of operating system error code (ValueType < 3). There is no dynamic download of a DLL to the VIC. DLLs must be manually installed on the VIC in either the system program folder (e.g. \\Windows\\System 32), or in a folder that is on the executable search path (the PATH environment variable). LoadDLL is a steady-state statement. If it stops, all VALUEs holding a copy of the DLLHandle returned from the LoadDLL statement will be invalidated, and if there are no other LoadDLLs running for the same DLL, the DLL will be unloaded. (LoadDLL is not an expensive operation, but it is good programming not to do this very often.) Note: LoadDLL will block the calling interpreter thread until the DLL loaded has completed on the VIC. This means that nothing else will execute on the VIC session thread until the DLL load is complete. This has the advantage (from the programmer's perspective) that the DLL handle returned is immediately ready for use. LoadDLL will return Invalid if there is a problem with the parameters, an integer error code if it cannot load the DLL, or a DLLHandle (ValueType ==38) if the load was successful. On failure, the return value will be the least significant 16-bits of operating system error code (ValueType < 3). DLL calls do not need to consume the return value, or have no return value should be written as such (i.e. explicitly specify a return type of zero to indicate that there is no return value, or that the return value is irrelevant. If you specify other than zero for the return type, the DLL call will block the calling interpret thread until the VIC has run the DLL call and returned the value. This means that scripts that rely on synchronous DLL calls will still work, even with the DLL remoted, however, they will slow down. If you specify a return value type of zero, a remoted DLL call is dispatched to the VIC asynchronously (i.e. your interpreter thread will not block). If, for example, you have a sequence of DLL calls that will execute asynchronously, followed by one that is synchronous (because you want the return value), the calling interpreter thread will block only on the synchronous call. This may take a little longer because the order of the DLL calls is preserved on the VIC, and all the asynchronous ones will have to complete execution before the synchronous one can be executed. This is much quicker than using all synchronous calls, because the asynchronous ones are batched together and require no reply (other than a batch acknowledgment from the VIC), reducing comms latency. DLL handles should not be declared as shared if they are going to be remoted. Shared DLLs will only be created once, and so will only operate on the server OR client, depending upon which one started them first.",

Because the logging function is designed to be general purpose, you must decide what information is appropriate to log. As a general rule, you should only log information that could be useful in diagnosing a hardware or software problem. The event logging facility is not intended to be used as a tracing tool. Event logging consumes system resources such as disk space and processor time. The amount of disk space that an event log requires depends on how much information you choose to log. For this reason, it is important to log only essential information. Following, are some Microsoft guidelines regarding the types of events you may wish to log for each severity Informational Information events indicate significant successful operations that occur infrequently. It is not generally considered appropriate for an application to log an event each time it starts. Warning Warning events indicate problems that are not immediately significant, but that may indicate conditions that could cause problems in the future. Generally, if an application can continue or recover from an event without loss of functionality or data, it can classify the event as a warning. Error Error events indicate significant problems about which the user should know. Error events usually result in or from the loss of functionality or data. Audit Failure When a security access attempt fails, it is considered an audit failure. A failed logon attempt is a failure audit event. Audit Success When a security access attempt succeeds, then it is a success audit event. For example, a successful logon attempt is a success audit event. For more information on NT Event Logging, please see the Microsoft MSDN documentation. The only required parameters for LogNTEvent are the severity code (Severity) and the string or array of strings to log with the event (Strings) You may optionally specify: The application event Source (the default value is \"VTScada\"). The Category (numeric starting at \"1\", where \"0\" is the \"none\" category). The default is \"0\" (none). The EventID (numeric, generally starting at 1000 or so to not conflict with the category numbers. The first and only defined EventID for source \"VTScada\" is \"1001\", which simply displays the passed-in string). Data and Datasize (used to store binary data with the event). DataSize should be the size, in bytes, of the Data array. Data is any array of binary data to be stored along with the event. And UNCServerName, which is the machine to which to log the event (the default is Invalid, which results in the event being logged on the local machine. Otherwise, you may specify the UNC name for the machine to which you would like the event logged ). Note that specifying values other than the defaults for Source or EventID will result in the event log displaying the event improperly, unless a custom DLL is written to handle the case. However, this does not prevent the event from being logged, and a custom DLL can be added at a later time.",

A self-signed certificate is one that has no chain of trust and, hence, to be trusted requires to be installed in a trusted root store or (better) the software that uses it is explicitly allowed to trust it. The issuer name written into the self-signed certificate is the same as the Common Name field in the Subject parameter. The Subject parameter has a familiar form to many other certificate generation packages. It is a sequence of: <identifier>=<value> separated by semi-colons, where identifier is one of the RFC 5280/X.520-specified fields. For example: CN=LPoint;O=Trihedral;OU=Engineering defining the Common Name as \"LPoint\", the Organization as \"Trihedral\" and the Organizational Unit as \"Engineering\". The KeyAlgorithm and HashAlgorithm are the Microsoft Cryptography Next Generation (CNG) algorithm names. For example \"RSA\" is a valid KeyAlgorithm and \"SHA256\" is a valid HashAlgorithm. The ValidityPeriod is expressed in days from the time of certificate creation. KeyStrength specifies the length of the key, in bits. For RSA this should be at least 2048 bits. Larger sizes are permitted but not commonly used at present. KeyUsage is a set of bit values that specify the intended usages for the private / public key pair. These are defined as: Constant #KeyUsageSignature        = 0x80;\r\n  Constant #KeyUsageNonRepudiation   = 0x40;\r\n  Constant #KeyUsageKeyEncipherment  = 0x20;\r\n  Constant #KeyUsageDataEncipherment = 0x10;\r\n  Constant #KeyUsageKeyAgreement     = 0x08;\r\n  Constant #KeyUsageCertSign         = 0x04;\r\n  Constant #KeyUsageCRLSign          = 0x02;\r\n  Constant #KeyEncipherOnly          = 0x01; These bits are combined for use with a certificate. RFC 5280 describes these bits and their purpose. For example, a combination of 0xF0 is typically used for client authentication purposes. EKU is a text value or an array of text values that define Extended Key Usages (sometimes called Enhanced Key Usages) that the keys are intended for. The text values are Object Identifiers (OIDs). Commonly used ones include: Server authentication\t1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.1 Client authentication\t1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.2 Code signing\t        1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.3 SAN is a text value or an array of text values that define Subject Alternative Names to be written into the certificate.

The operations in the DiffBuff are formatted as follows: The low 31 bits of the first four bytes hold the length of the data portion, measured in bytes. The highest bit of those first four bytes will be a 0 to indicate that this is a delete operation or a 1 to indicate that this is an add operation. The next four bytes hold the offset into the source buffer where the operation should take place. The final \"length\" bytes (where length was defined in the first 31 bits) hold the data to be added in the case that this is an add operation. \"DiffBuff\" could be the result from the Diff function. Merge assumes that the diffs in DiffBuff are ordered and correct, hence does no checking for offsets outside SourceBuff, etc. It is the responsibility of the caller to get it right.

A conflict is defined as any of the following: Two additions occurring at the same location and adding different data. One deletion and one addition where the addition occurs within  the range of the deletion. Information describing the nature of the failure is provided to the fourth and fifth parameters. The sixth parameter is provided with a combined Diff buffer containing all of the changes that did not conflict. Rules applied to detect conflicts: 1. Both operations delete and overlapping deletes are combined to create a composite delete. If the composite delete conflicts with a subsequent add, all of the constituent deletes of the composite delete are also marked as being conflicts. 2. Both are addition operations. Conflict can only occur at the offset. If additions occur at different offsets then there is no Conflict. If additions occur at the same offset with the same data, then there is no conflict. If additions occur at the same offset, but adding different data then there is a conflict. 3. One operation adds and the other deletes. If addition occurs within the range of the deletion operation then there is a conflict. If addition occurs outside of the range of the deletion operation, then there is no conflict. When two records are determined to be conflicting based on the previous rules, we need to go through all previously saved records marked #Pending to move them to  the conflicting dictionary. If there are conflicts between the two Diffs, the subroutine returns conflict information, whereas if there are none then the two diffs are simultaneously applied to the source buffer.

It is not possible to change the media mode to a mode other than those specified when the ModemStream was created. If the requested Media change cannot be implemented, the function will return Invalid. The function will also return Invalid if there is no active call in progress on ModemStream. If Interactive Voice (4), or Automated Voice (8) is specified, then the modem will be initialized in voice mode. On outgoing calls, this has the effect that progress indication is unreliable - the call will be reported as connected as soon as dialing completes. This is a limitation of analog voice modems. Changes to media mode may not happen instantly. For example, changing a call from voice mode to data mode initiates the modem training sequence that may take several seconds to complete. The return value of the ModemMedia function indicates the current state, and so can be used to determine when the change has completed.",

    "comments": "Some readers may have used non-persisted StartTag calls to create parent/child tag structures.  Now that StartTag is obsolete, those structures should be created with the Tag Browser, not in code. This module launches a worker module into Code so that the operation is not interrupted by this module's caller being slain.  The return value of the function is a reference to this worker module. By watching for this to become invalid, you can discover when the module has finished. ModifyTags works by modifying root tag declarations or adding overrides for child tags not defined in the root tag database.  It does  not modify tag type definitions. The TagParameters dictionary is formatted as follows: TagParameters[FullFriendlyName] = {TheChange}; For tag deletion, {TheChange} is simply Invalid. For a creation or update, {TheChange} is a dictionary of parameter values, keyed by parameter name. When creating a new tag, the NewTags dictionary must have an entry specifying the tag type.  If there is a tag with the given name already running, it will be deleted and the new tag will be created with a new unique ID, even if the type specified in NewTags is the same as the type  of the currently-running tag.  Hence, this is a way to stop a tag and create a tag having the same friendly name, but a different unique ID and possibly a different type, all in a single operation. When updating a tag, what will happen to tag parameters that are not specified in the TagParameters dictionary will depend on the value of the Merge parameter.  If TRUE (the default), then those parameters remain unchanged  by the operation.  If FALSE, then those parameters revert to their default, where default for a root tag is the default specified in the tag type, and the default for a child tag is the value specified by its parent's type's child tag definition record (that is, the value it would have without any root overrides). The Merge parameter has no effect on tag additions or deletions. To set parameters to expressions, you can set metadata on individual parameter values. For example: TagParms[TagName][ParmName] = ExpressionText; Metadata(TagParms[TagName][ParmName], System.#EXPRESS_META) = System.#EXPRESS_REFRESH; {non-optimized expression} Metadata(TagParms[TagName][ParmName], System.#EXPRESS_META) = System.#EXPRESS_SNAPSHOT; {optimized expression} If HaveLock is TRUE, then when this module finishes, the memory cache of tag parameters will have been updated, and those changes will be pending to be written out to tag files and incorporated into running tags.  Note that there is no guarantee that those actions have been performed.  That will happen during the next commit. If HaveLock is FALSE, then it is guaranteed that all running tags  affected by these changes will have been updated or stopped (whichever applies).  Also, while all root tags and all child tags (whose parents are running and that the changes cause to bring into existence) will be running, it is not guaranteed that they will have run their Refresh modules.  It is also not guaranteed that children of tags just started will be running yet let alone Refreshed. When called with the Merge==FALSE parameter it is possible to revert a tag parameter to its default or remove an override using the API GetTagConfiguredParameters .  If ModifyTags is called with Merge=FALSE without using this API, there is no way to remove some configured parameters while keeping others. To make changes to some configured parameters, called GetTagConfiguredParameters, modify the dictionary of parameters (add/modify/remove), then pass the modified dictionary into a call to ModifyTags.",

If Value exceeds HighScale, the object will extend past its bounding box. Low and high scale values may be calculated expressions. The compiler will reduce them to constants if they evaluate to constants. If any parameters are invalid, the resulting value will still be valid normalized value.

    "comments": "If the UserName and Password parameters are specified as invalid, the DSName parameter is treated as a literal connection string for the ODBC connection. For example, in the statement ODBCConnect(\"DSN=MyData;UID=;PWD=\", Invalid, Invalid), the first parameter is used to set the attributes of the connection, which makes this statement equivalent to ODBCConnect(\"MyData\", \"\", \"\"). In the case of the optional parameters, any parameter that is not required may be set to 0 if it is followed by a valid parameter, or may be simply omitted if no valid parameters follow it. On successful completion of the ODBC and ODBCConnect functions, the native error code will be set to 0, allowing the user to tell if a command that has no result set has been completed. The user should not assume that since a 0 is returned, then the command has been executed successfully. Some drivers (such as Excel) will return a 0 in the native error code, even when an error has occurred. All ODBC operations can result in one or more status or error conditions arising. VTScada records the entire set of status/error conditions arising and buffers them internally. Use the ODBCStatus function to retrieve the entire set. Only the first condition that occurred or, if both error and advisory conditions occur, the first error condition, is returned in the ErrorMsg and SQLState values. From VTS 10.0 onwards, VTS uses ODBC 3.x compliant operations (formerly ODBC 2.x). This has the side effect that different SQLState return values are returned for some SQLState values. If you have written code that depends on the value returned by SQLState, you may need to change the value you expect. See http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms712451%28VS.85%29.aspx for a reference on the value changes. 64-bit VTScada is able to connect to either 64-bit or 32-bit ODBC data sources. ODBCConnect will first try to connect to the database through a 64-bit ODBC driver. If this fails for any reason it will then try the connection through a 32-bit ODBC driver. This means that any ODBC code that worked under 32-bit VTScada should not need to be modified for use with 64-bit VTScada, but 64-bit VTScada has the extra ability of being able to use 64-bit ODBC drivers.",

Running a deploy operation after ModifyTags' change, results in the entire tag file (and all the included tags and their parameters) being deployed.  OpChange is able to deploy just the one change to the one tag within the file, leaving other modified tags in that file as local changes. OpChanges are used for any tag change that is expected to be performed during systems operation, as opposed to changes made during configuration. The example is an operator changing a tag's questionable status by using the context menu rather than opening the configuration dialog. When called with the Merge==FALSE parameter it is possible to revert a tag parameter to its default or remove an override using the API GetTagConfiguredParameters .  If OPChange is called with Merge=FALSE without using this API, there is no way to remove some configured parameters while keeping others. To make changes to some configured parameters, called GetTagConfiguredParameters, modify the dictionary of parameters (add/modify/remove), then pass the modified dictionary into a call to OPChange.",

All that is required is that the Unpack MirrorKey dictionary has all of the structures that are in that particular packed stream. If the KeyDictionary doesnât have the structure that was packed, the returned data is a simple array rather than a structure.

This is because the Pack function will create a new stream under certain circumstances and store the packed data in it. If the variable that StreamVarPtr addresses contains a stream, then the data will be packed into that stream. If the variable that StreamVarPtr addresses contains Invalid, Pack will create a new buffer stream, pack the data into it and store the new stream in the variable pointed at by StreamVarPtr. If a buffer stream is supplied, or Pack creates a buffer stream, it will be replaced by a temporary file stream if the output stream exceeds 2Mb. This provides a balance between performance and memory use. If a stream is provided, packing starts at the current stream position. After packing, the stream current position is left at the end of the packed data. Only variables of numeric, text, or stream types will be packed. Arrays of those types, up to and including 3 dimensions, will also be packed. Any illegal values are packed as Invalid. Further, the Pack function has been designed in such a way that multidimensional arrays that have not had a value assigned can be handled. After the stream is unpacked, the array elements are allocated, but are assigned Invalid. Generally called in the form: Pack(Self(), 1, NParm(Self()), &Stream); This works because NParm(Self()) equals the highest index.",

Making the button combination specified by the Button parameter outside the target area and then sliding the cursor into the target will not cause the function to return true. If the locator is not installed, the function will return false (0). This function is very useful for capturing fast mouse button presses by the operator. VTScada remembers the locations where the mouse buttons were pressed and released. The actual buttons do not have to be pressed when the Pick is actually executed since it will examine the list of all button changes since the last time it was executed.

        "description": "Required. Any numeric parameter giving the manual/auto mode for the function. When the parameter is not equal to 0, the function is in auto mode and uses the PID algorithm to control the output. When the parameter is equal to 0, the function simply returns the value of the Track parameter. When the mode switches from manual to auto, the PID function implements a \"bumpless transfer.\" This results in a smooth output change rather than an abrupt change. This is done by forcing the internal integral to assume a value which forces the PID function to output a value which matches the Track parameter at the moment of the change. The integral value will not, however, exceed the value imposed upon it by the LowLimit and HighLimit parameters. Mode Algorithm Derivative Gains 0 Manual N/A N/A 1 Normal Uses PV Independent 2 Normal Uses PV Dependent 3 Normal Uses Error Independent 4 Reverse Uses Error Dependent 5 Reverse Uses PV Independent 6 Reverse Uses PV Dependent 7 Reverse Uses Error Independent The PID function operates in eight automatic modes and one manual mode. These modes are listed in the above table. If in doubt, use mode 1 or 5. The Action column in the above table indicates whether the PID function operates using normal action (SP - PV) or reverse action (PV - SP). With normal action, when PV increases, the function output decreases. With reverse action, when PV increases, the function output increases also. The Derivative column in the above table indicates whether the PID function derivative bases its value upon PV or the error between PV and SP. For normal action, the error is (SP - PV). For reverse action, the error is (PV - SP). The difference between the two modes is only clear when the setpoint (SP) is changed. If the derivative uses PV, the response to setpoint changes is normal. If the derivative uses the error, the response to setpoint changes is faster but usually produces an abrupt change in the PID function output which is often undesirable. The Gains column in the above table indicates which PID equation is used. Refer to the \"Comments\" section for these equations. The independent gains equation uses seconds as the time base and the gain parameter (P) does not affect either the integral or derivative. The dependent gain equation is the ISA equation. It uses minutes as the time base and the gain parameter (P) affects both the integral and derivative."

        "description": "Required (Format version 1 only). Any numeric expression giving the style of the plot. The plot Style gives the line style, direction, bit number for bits plots, and the number of points to average per point displayed. The Style is determined by adding together the following values: Line style + Direction + Path + Bit number + Average Line style is a number between 1 and 5 inclusive which gives the line style for line plots. A line style of 1 indicates a solid line (see Chapter 9 for more styles). For bar plots, the line style portion of the Style parameter is ignored. Direction is either 0 or 10. Use 0 for a standard horizontal plot (array index runs along the X axis and values are plotted up or down). Use 10 for a vertical plot (array index runs along the Y axis and values are plotted left or right). Path is either 0 or 50. A 0 indicates that line plots are to be drawn directly from point to point. A 50 indicates that plots are to be drawn in a step fashion with two line segments between each point. The first segment runs parallel to the X-axis and the second segment runs parallel to the Y-axis. This produces a square-looking plot. These step plots are useful for plotting status values which change in jumps rather than continuously. The Path value is ignored for bar plots. Bit number is either 0 or a value starting at 100. This is the number of the bit to use in the array data for plotting. If the normal entire value of the data is to be plotted, use 0 for this value. If only one of the bits from the data is to be plotted, use the bit number plus 1. The value to add is (Bit number + 1) * 100 or 0. The ability to plot only a single bit from an array of short or long values allows status data to be stored very efficiently by not requiring a separate array for each status value. For bit plots, the value plotted is always a 0 or a 1 corresponding to the value of the selected bit. The use of this plotting option is usually done in conjunction with a Path value of 50 for step plots. Average is either 0 or a value starting at 10000. This is the number of consecutive array points to average to give a single point on the screen. It can be used to plot a very large array of values on the screen without having to draw all of the points on the screen. This will produce a smoothed plot and reduce the drawing time. The number to add is (Data points per displayed point - 1) * 10000."

If PlotXY senses that the Style parameter is a Pen, XORMode, DrawStepped, BitNumber, and Average parameters will become relevant. The Style is determined by adding together the following values. Line style + Direction + Path + Bit number + Average Line style is a number between 1 and 10 inclusive which gives the line style for line plots. A line style of 1 indicates a solid line. For other line styles, the background color is set to the current background screen color. Direction is either 0 or 10. A 0 indicates a horizontal plot and a 10 indicates a vertical plot. Path is either 0 or 50. A 0 indicates that line plots are to be drawn directly from point to point. A 50 indicates that plots are to be drawn in a step fashion with two line segments between each point. The first segment runs parallel to the X-axis and the second segment runs parallel to the Y-axis. This produces a square-looking plot. These step plots are useful for plotting status values which change in jumps rather than continuously. Bit number is the number of the bit to use in the YArray data for plotting. If the normal entire value of the data is to be plotted, use 0 for this value. If only one of the bits from the data is to be plotted, use the bit number plus 1. The value to add is (Bit number + 1) * 100 or 0. The ability to plot only a single bit from an array of short or long values allows status data to be stored very efficiently by not requiring a separate array for each status value. For bit plots, the value plotted is always a 0 or a 1 corresponding to the value of the selected bit. The use of this plotting option is usually done in conjunction with a Path value of 50 for step plots. Average is the number of consecutive array points to average to give a single point on the screen. Both XArray and YArray values are averaged. It can be used to plot a very large array of values on the screen without having to draw all of the points on the screen. This will produce a smoothed plot and reduce the drawing time. The number to add is (Data points per displayed point + 1) * 10000."

The calling code can use the Result parameter to determine when the user has completed the dialog box (see Result above). In addition to the Result parameter, the function itself will return an error code to indicate whether the dialog was successfully opened. A \"1\" indicates failure to open while a \"0\" indicates success. The caller of this function is expected to supply the MinPage and MaxPage parameters, representing the minimum and maximum page number from which the user may select. FirstPage and LastPage can be initially set to any values between MinPage and MaxPage. If the combination of the four values is not logical (e.g. LastPage is smaller than FirstPage), VTScada will force logical values for the dialog. When Result is set to one, FirstPage and LastPage will contain the page range that the user selected. If Result is set to zero (i.e. the user has canceled the dialog), FirstPage and LastPage are left at their initial values. Setting MinPage and MaxPage to Invalid or to equal values will disable the page range field. NumCopies can likewise contain an initial value, and will be set to the user-selected number of copies if Result returns a value of one. The initial value of the Selection radio button is controlled by the value of the variable provided for the AllowSelection parameter: If the variable's value evaluates to a non-zero positive number, the Selection radio button will be selected. If the variable's value is zero, the radio-button will initially be unselected. When the Print button on the print dialog box is clicked, this variable receives a zero if the Selection radio-button was not selected and one if it was selected.

Execution of the Return statement in a subroutine results in the module being slain without having to use the Slay statement. If the Return statement is used in a called module (i.e. one that appears as a statement in a state), execution of the Return statement will not stop the execution of the module. The return value for the module is set equal to the first parameter, and is the same type as the expected value of the module call. The type of the return value is set every time Return is executed, which allows modules to return different types of values during execution if they are called (rather than launched). This statement may appear inside or outside of a script, and like other statements that may be called from a state, if multiple calls are active simultaneously in a module, the return value will be invalid. WARNING: Latching Behavior and If statements If the Return statement is placed within a script block of a called module, and if that module is called by an If statement, then the return value will be reset to Invalid after the If statement executes. This is similar to the behavior of latching functions such as AbsTime() and Watch(). See example 2. This behavior is not desirable for some called modules. The same goes for some modules that set their return value from script using SetReturnValue. For these, set the parameter Resettable to FALSE. Return(); is equivalent to Return(Invalid);",

    "comments": "Each record of data in the array will be inserted into its correct position based on its timestamp. For this reason the transfer to the file will be more efficient if the timestamps are in increasing chronological order, however, any order is allowed. Any records that have an invalid timestamp will be skipped. Because this function is threaded and runs as a background job, there is no way to tell when the data has all been written to the file other than by checking its contents, however, multiple Save or SaveHistory commands will get written to the file in correct locations based on their timestamps. If a Get or TGet statement is executed, the SaveHistory statement will write all of its data to the file prior to the data retrieval. This also occurs if the application is stopped. If the target file does not exist, SaveHistory will create it. To do this, SaveHistory needs to determine the column structure of the file. Whereas Save has parameters allowing the format to be explicitly defined, there are no equivalent parameters to SaveHistory. Instead, SaveHistory will analyze the first record that is to be written and determine the parameter type required for each column. In order to ensure that the correct format is determined, it is advisable to make the first record a template record. A template record would have an invalid timestamp followed by column values that unambiguously identify the range of values for each column (see the Save function for a description of the data types). In the case of text values, the template string should be the same length as the maximum required length. If Mode has the value 2, then the understanding is that a series of SaveHistory functions are to be performed on the file and that each will be written at the end of the file (if the write is not at end of file, then Mode = 0 is forced). The invalid record that is written at the end of the file identifies that the file is still (conceptually) open. Should the system suffer any form of abrupt shutdown, then this status will be preserved in the file and will be of use in learning the validity of file data. The final SaveHistory to such a file should be written with Mode = 3. This will change the invalid record to one which signifies that the file is no longer open. If Mode has the value 4, then SaveHistory compares the data supplied in Array2dElem with the data already existing in the file, for the time range specified by the earliest record in the data and the value of EndTime. The comparison reviews the validity of each record (a record is deemed invalid if all columns are invalid) and splits both sets of data into periods of validity and invalidity. The resulting file will contain all valid records from both data sets and those invalid records where both data sets saw an invalid.",

It is up to script code to convert the parameter to the appropriate representation depending on the mode used. As an example, when setting the IV, a binary string of bytes is expected, which is the same representation as a string in script code and this can be passed in directly. When setting ChainingMode, a text string with the desired mode is expected, for example âChainingModeECBâ. The underlying API expects this input as utf-16le characters, so script code must first convert this to null terminated utf-16le. This can be achieved using TextEncode: SetKeyParam(Key,\r\n            \"ChainingMode\",\r\n            TextEncode(Concat(\"ChainingModeECB\", MakeBuff(1, 0)),\r\n                       Invalid,\r\n                       \"utf-8\",\r\n                       \"utf-16le\"),\r\n            0,\r\n            ErrOut)",

A module reference box, or MRB as it is sometimes called, is not a clipping region and objects can and often will extend outside of their MRB as a result of applied rotations or trajectories. When a module is transformed, the transform is based on the size of the module as determined by its reference box. If the module switches states, the active graphics will change, thereby changing the MRB for that module. The result is that the transform will change such that graphic objects will grow or shrink, so that the module's reference box will always exactly fill the reference box of the transform. In the case of graphics that have had a rotation or trajectory applied to them, the graphics will be transformed correctly, but the MRB may no longer contain the objects in their modified positions. This statement allows the user to set the reference box of a module to a constant size, so that as graphics become active and inactive, the transform will not cause the graphic objects to grow and shrink - since the transform is based on the module's reference box, and this is now fixed, the transform will be similarly fixed. This call should be followed by a call to SaveModule, otherwise the module reference box change will only be written when the application containing this statement is stopped (in the case of base VTScada code this means when VTScada is shut down). Great care should be exercised when using this statement, since the module reference box for the module itself is altered, not just the instance in which the statement is called. All instances of this module will have their reference box permanently changed.",

Outbound buffers on a socket are limited to a maximum of 64Mb (the default). Writing a large volume of data to a socket faster than the socket can be drained could result in excessive memory usage, so exceeding the socket output buffer limit will result in the socket being closed and the memory being released. Note that the output buffer limit is NOT the same as the transmit buffer size parameter on a SocketServerStart or ClientSocket statement. Those parameters control the size of the buffers that the operating system uses for socket data transmission. The return value for options 0 and 6 is the machine name stored as a text value. If the name cannot be found it will return the internet address of the socket as a text string. Options 6 through 9 differ from options 0 and 2 through 4 only in the fact that they are buffered. This means that an initial inquiry will be made to the operating system and stored in a buffer, and after that, all inquiries will be handed the value stored in the buffer. This makes options 6 through 9 significantly faster than the other options, however, any online changes to the workstation's attributes will be not be discovered by options 6 to 9, only 0 and 2 to 4 would return the new values. If using option 13 to activate optional filters, note that (as of VTScada version 12.1) TLS/SSL and WebSocket are the only ones supported. Option 19 provides control operations for protocol filters that support this: FilterID = \"WSKT\" Opcode == 0 (Activate). Data is ignored, if present. Opcode == 1 (Max Rx Time). Data is an integer number of seconds allowed between the start of a WebSocket protocol frame and its end (range 1-65535). This is to prevent a malicious actor from holding the port open. Defaults to 60 seconds. Opcode == 2 (Ping time). Data is an integer number of seconds during which if there is no communication on the connection, a WebSocket protocol PING frame will be transmitted (range 0-65535). A value of zero disables the PING. Defaults to zero. Opcode == 3 (Close time). Data is an integer number of seconds to wait after issuing a WebSocket protocol CLOSE frame before closing the connection (range 3-65535). This is to allow the remote end to transmit its CLOSE frame in response and is provided to prevent the remote end from refusing to send a CLOSE frame and hold the connection open. Defaults to 3. Opcode == 4 (Tx Max Frame Size). Data is an integer number of bytes that will be contained in a transmitted WebSocket protocol frame. Messages to be transmitted that are longer than this will be fragmented into multiple frames. Defaults to 4096. Note: Do not use an excessively large number, even though this is a 32-bit quantity. FilterID = \"RAW\" Opcode == 0 Data == Maximum size of the output buffer for the socket, in  bytes. If more data than this is pending transmission from the output buffer, the socket will be closed and the stream will go Invalid.",

    "comments": "Sort allows the re-ordering of a group of related arrays according to the order of a key array. If KeyArray and SortArray are the same array, the array is arranged in order. Be aware that sorting is a relatively time-consuming operation. It should not be active during time-critical control, etc. Do not mix sorting modes. Some code may rely on sorting to be basic case-insensitive alphabetical (non-locale-aware) order, while other code may expect it to be locale-aware. Mixing these is likely to produce errors. In particular, if you Sort an array and then use TextSearch on it, you must ensure that each uses the same sorting mode with the same locale. This statement performs a \"partition sort\", using an element of the array as the dividing point, such that all other elements are divided into those greater than and less than the dividing element. Each partition is then recursively sorted. As of VTS version 7.5, the first and middle elements of the array are swapped, making the middle element the partitioning element. This has increased performance gains for arrays whose sizes reach 100,000 or more elements. This statement is useful when used with PlotXY. For example, if there are two arrays, one having X-value and the other Y-values, of 100 data values that need to be viewed plotted against each other, the Sort statement could re-order the arrays so that the X values increased from left to right and the Y values stayed with their corresponding X values (see example). The order of the statements is significant. If the sort of the X array were done first, the sort of the Y array would have no effect since the X array would already be in order. In general, the key array should be sorted last. The statement uses a minimum of eight bytes of temporary memory for each numeric array element in the sort, or more if the element has been declared to be text. This means that at least 8 * N bytes of memory is required, which may be of concern if N is large and the amount of free memory is minimal. Invalid array entries in the key array are grouped to the end of the array.",

This function will execute and immediately return, sending the text to the speech engine to be spoken asynchronously. Asynchronous speech will not block the calling thread. You can determine when a section of text has completed speaking by inserting bookmarks into the text that can then be watched for in the VoiceTalk BookmarkNum parameter. Multiple VoiceTalk\\Speak statements can be issued on SAPI text-to-speech streams without blocking. The text will be queued up and will be spoken in the order it is submitted. The text speech queue will be terminated immediately if the SAPI text-to-speech stream is closed. If speaking simultaneously on several streams, all to the same output device, the thread that is currently speaking will continue to do so until all its queued text has been spoken, even if the other thread issues VoiceTalk\\Speak calls during this time. The text string spoken can optionally contain embedded \"control tags\" that affect the way that the text is spoken. These control tags are in the form of embedded XML. For example, <EMPH> and </EMPH> emphasizes the words between the tags, and <BOOKMARK MARK=\"32\"/> sets the SAPI text-to-speech stream current bookmark number to 32. In order for embedded XML to be parsed, either the text stream must be enabled to process XML (by passing a value for Flags that includes the value 8), or the text string itself must begin with an angle bracket (<). For a complete list of embedded control tags, please refer to the Microsoft SAPI 5.1 speech documentation.",

    "comments": "Only selection queries are supported. SQL statements for data manipulation will do nothing. If tag filtering or realm-area filter is in effect, this function will retrieve data only from tags the currently logged-on user is permitted to access. When retrieving historical data, SQLQuery is essentially a wrapper for GetTagHistory. It takes an incoming SQL query, and makes one or more calls to GetTagHistory to retrieve the results. SQLQuery may also be used to retrieve current tag values and other custom tables (such as alarm data). Legacy tables made it look like tag values were stored in separate tables and used the time stamp of the current server. These legacy tables still exist but are hidden by default, using the property: SQLQueryHideLegacyTables. Newer code should query all tag values from the table, \"History\", or from a \":TPP\"derivative such as \"History:1d\". See the links for further information. Supported SQL syntax is as follows: SELECT [DISTINCT | ALL] columnspecifier-1, columnspecifier-2, ... FROM tablename-1, tablename-2, ... [WHERE where-expression] [ORDER BY columnspecifier-1 [ASC | DESC], columnspecifier-2, ...] [LIMIT [offset,] row_count] Columnspecifier is either [table-name.]'*' to indicate all columns in a table or a specific column-name in the form: [table-name.]column-name Tablename is either the table name or 'table-name [[AS] alias-name'] Quotes may be used around table or column names, and must be used if the names contain special characters. When an alias-name is specified it may be used in place of the table-name in the column specifier. When more than one table is specified, the tables are automatically joined based on their Timestamp columns and MUST have matching \"TPP\"s. A join expression may be used in place of a table list, but it is only parsed to extract the tables specified. The actual join expression is ignored. Where-expression is an expression to be used to filter the result data. It may contain references to columns, use comparison operators, use functions ABS, LENGTH, UPPER, LOWER, CONCAT, CASE, SQRT, INTEGER, and use keywords AND, NOT, and OR. Use the LIMIT clause to specify a limit to the number of rows that will be returned, and optionally an offset (0-based) which allows pagination. LIMIT is applied after WHERE filtering and after sorting. If there is no explicit LIMIT clause in the query there is an implicit \"LIMIT SQLQueryMaxResultRows\" ( Settings.Dynamic setting) added. Each logged tag corresponds to one table in the VTS database schema. Every logged variable within the tag is one column. In addition, a \"TPP specifier\" may be appended to a tag name to utilize GetTagHistory's ability to retrieve data over time periods. The TPP specifier is a colon followed by a number and an abbreviation for various time periods. The recognized time period abbreviations are (case-insensitive): MS - milliseconds S - seconds (this is the default, therefore the S may be left out) M - minutes H - hours D - days W - weeks Y - years For example, the table 'ai1:2D' can be used to retrieve data from tag ai1 with a TPP of 2 days. A TPP may only be specified for a tag that has at least one numeric logged variable. When a TPP is specified, the available columns are: Timestamp VarName:Average VarName:Minimum Varname:Maximum VarName:Delta VarName:ValueAtStart VarName:TimeOfMin VarName:TimeOfMax VarName:ZToNZCount VarName:NonZeroTime VarName:Total VarName:Interpolate ... where VarName may be replaced by any numeric logged variable from the tag. The current values of a tag may be retrieved using a table name with the format \"TagName_Current\". This table will have one row whose columns are Timestamp (the current time) and the current values of each logged value in the tag. Bit-Wise queries can be created, similar to modes 12 and 13 of calls to GetTagHistory(). To specify a bit-wise summary, use either: Tag Name:Value:BitwiseOR Tag Name:Value:BitwiseAND For example: Select Timestamp, as1:value:average, as1:value:BitwiseOR from History_1h where Timestamp >= '2017-10-02 00:00' and Timestamp <= '2017-10-02 23:59'",

This format is similar, but not identical, to the C language format string for the scanf function, whereby each of the % format specifications assigns a value to one of the Vn parameters in the statement in the order in which each appears in the list. Note that like a standard text string, these format specifiers must also be enclosed by double quotes. If a format specification appears for which there are no remaining V parameters, the format specification value is read and discarded. For the % format specifications, the following form applies (where the [ ] indicates optional elements): %[*][width]type Whereâ¦ % Is a mandatory character * The optional asterisk     causes the read to occur as per the format specification, but suppresses any assignment to the Vn parameters. width Width is optional, specifying the maximum number of characters to read. type The specifications for type are listed in the following table: Format strings are case insensitive. Additionally, specifying a character for a type that is not in this list results in all the characters following the % up to that point to be read exactly as they appear in the Format string and discarded. Type Meaning Nb Binary format, where n is a number indicating the type of value (see below) c Single ASCII character (byte) d Signed decimal 64-bit integer e Signed exponential f Signed floating point g e or f formats i Signed decimal integer l Line of characters terminated by a carriage return, line feed, or both n Present offset in the buffer o Signed octal, 32-bit default* s Text string t Counted string u Unsigned decimal 64-bit integer x Signed hex integer using \"abcdef\", 32-bit default* znnn Escape character where nnn is the 3-digit ASCII code %x and %o will treat values as 32-bit integers by default unless the %ll modifier is used. %llx and %llo will read values in 64-bit. for %u, when reading an unsigned 64bit integer greater than 9223372036854775807 (the largest signed 64bit integer), the value will be read in as the bit-equivalent signed 64bit integer. ( eg. 9223372036854775808 is read in as -9223372036854775808.) nb, Binary type For the format specification of %nb, where n specifies the type of number, n must be a single digit from one of the following choices. All are low-byte-first. n value Type 0 Byte 1 Short integer (2 bytes, low byte first) 2 Long integer (4 bytes, low bytes first) 3 IEEE single precision float (4 bytes) 4 <obsolete> 5 IEEE double precision float (8 bytes) 6 <obsolete> 7 Binary unsigned short (2 bytes, low byte first) 8 Unsigned 32-bit integer 9 64-bit FileTime. This reads or writes a 64 bit time value in the Microsoft FileTime format.  When reading, the value is converted from the FileTime epoch and units (100 nanosecond intervals since Jan 1, 1601) to the VTS epoch and units (seconds since 1/1/1970) any times earlier than this will result in a value of 0.  When writing, the value is converted from the VTS epoch and units to the FileTime epoch and units. c,  ASCII character type :  Unlike BuffWrite this type deals with characters in a string; each character being equal to one byte. Unlike the %s option, which reads only up to the first white-space character, the %c option reads the number of characters/bytes specified by its width and is not terminated by any particular character. If no width is specified, a single character is read. d,  Signed decimal integer e,  Signed exponential f,  Signed floating point g,  e or f formats i,  Signed decimal integer type: This option normally reads a decimal integer; however, if a leading \"0b\" is encountered, the number will be interpreted as binary. If a leading \"0\" (zero only) is encountered, the number will be interpreted as octal. If a leading \"0x\" is encountered, the number will be interpreted as hexadecimal. For decimal, values will be read as 64-bit integers, but hex, octal and binary will be treated as 32-bit integers unless the %lli modifier is used, which will cause the %i format to treat hex, octal and binary as 64-bit. l,  Line of characters: This option reads a line of characters terminated by a carriage return, a line feed, or both (in either order). The carriage return and line feed will be discarded, and the next character read will be the first character on the next line. The maximum number of characters read is 2GiB (2^30 bytes) or less if the width option is used. n,  Buffer offset :  This option does not read a value, but returns the present offset in Buffer and can be useful in subsequent reads. o,  Unsigned Octal s,  Text string type: Text in the string is read up until a white-space character is encountered, or the specified width has been read, whichever is smaller. Square brackets enclosing a character, group of characters, or a caret and a group of characters used in the format string reads strings not delimited by spaces. This is a substitute for the %s format specification. The input is read up to the first character that does not appear inside the square brackets (note that this is case-sensitive). A dash may be used to specify a range of characters. For example, the following format specifier: % [A-Fa-f] will read a string up to the first which is not an A, B, C, D, E, or F both upper and lower case. t, Counted string type A counted string is encoded as a sequence of UTF-8 characters without a null terminator and preceded by the length in bytes. The length in bytes is encoded as Int32, i.e. a \"%2b\". A value of â1 is used to indicate an invalid string, a value of 0 indicates a null (\"\") string. Do not apply width or precision modifiers to a \"%t\" counted string. The caret symbol ^. If the first character inside the square brackets is a caret ( ^ ), the read progresses up to, but not including, the first character that appears inside the square brackets: %[^X-Z] This would read a string up to, but not including, the first X, Y or Z (upper-case only); if the string were terminated by an X, the next character read would be that X. Inside the square brackets, the backslash is used as an escape character - any character following a backslash (such as a caret, dash, or backslash) is taken as that character without special meaning. For example: %[^X-Z\\^] would behave as described previously, except that the string would now be read up to but not including the first X, Y, Z, or ^. Because format specifications for the Vn parameters are indicated by a percentage sign, to read (and discard) an actual percentage sign as part of the text string, precede it with a backslash character (i.e. \\%). Also, since the backslash character is used in this manner, as well as with special control characters such as line feed, carriage return and form feed, to read and discard a backslash, use two backslash characters (i.e. \\\\). x, Hexadecimal characters: the %x option reads the number of characters/bytes specified by its width and is not terminated by any particular character. If no width is specified, it will continue reading all bytes that can be recognized as hexadecimal characters. For example, given the string \"â¦= 3D\",  %[^=]=%2x  would read the hedadecimal value, 3D (decimal value, 61). znnn,   Escape characters: This specifies an escape character that will be thrown away when read, where nnn is a 3-digit number giving the ASCII character code of the escape character. This option is generally used as the sole format specifier that reads an entire string, spaces included, discarding every single occurrence of an escape character, or the first occurrence of every pair of escape characters. For example, if the string to be read looked like: abXc dXXfghiXXXjXXXXkl mX Xn o and the format specifier indicated that the ASCII code for 'X' (88) was to be the escape code: %25z088 then the variable that this was read into would contain: abc dXfghiXjXXkl m n o Notice that for each occurrence of X, the character immediately following it is saved, even if it is itself an escape character. Then the next occurrence of the escape character is discarded, with the character following it being saved, regardless of what it is, and so on. The width field specifies the maximum number of bytes to place in the output string; if this number is smaller than the input string (less the offending escape characters), the string will be truncated. If no width is specified, a single character will be read. Control characters: In order to encode certain control characters as part of the Format parameter, one of two methods may be used. The first is to use a backslash character followed by one of the single character codes listed below to produce the desired result. Please note that the letters must be lower case. Code Meaning \\b Backspace \\f Form Feed \\n Line Feed \\r Carriage Return \\t Horizontal Tab \\v Vertical Tab In addition to the predefined codes, an alternate form may be used: \\nnn: where nnn is a three digit integer in the range of 0 to 255 specifying a certain ASCII character. If the number contains less than three digits, the leading spaces must be padded with zeroes; this is not the case with the previously listed single character control characters. For example, to include the one byte ASCII character G in the output, you could place its decimal equivalent of 71 in the Format string as \\071."

If the first parameter (Parent) is not VTSDB, then it should be a tag object (the parent tag), and the StartTag call should only be made from that parent tag's Refresh module. When this function is used to create an ordinary tag, as opposed to a child tag, it is the responsibility of the programmer to ensure that a unique name is used for each new tag. If the tag does not exist and bit 0 of Flags is TRUE, then the tag is launched. If the tag exists and bit 0 of Flags is TRUE, then the tag's parameters are changed if necessary. Note that, if a new TagType is provided, then the existing tag will be deleted and a tag of the new type created. If the tag exists and bit 0 of Flags is FALSE or the tag's parent's Name is Invalid indicating that the tag is being stopped, then the tag is removed. Because of configuration management and the version control system, it is possible for a child tag have both temporary parameters (those created by code in the parent and existing only in memory) and a sub-set of permanent parameters in the tag files. These latter values are used to record user-overrides of the parameter values. If the application restarts, the child tag will be re-loaded from code and the overrides made in an earlier session will be read from the tag files. Permanent parameter values will always take precedence over temporary values. There are several ways that the tag's parameters can be passed to this module: Only one additional parameter which is an array of parameter values, a tag, or a tag mirror structure(*). In the case of a parameter value array the values must match to tags parameters in order, but may be fewer in number, allowing just the name to be passed, for example. Only one additional parameter which is a dictionary of parameter values keyed by parameter name. A pair of arrays is passed, with the first array being the array of parameter names and the second, parallel array, being the values for those named parameters. The \"Name\" parameter must be present, and the order of the pairs is not significant, other than matching  the formal parameter ordering gives some efficiency gains. A list of parameter name and value pairs of parameters. This is  typically used by ChildLaunch calls. Again \"name\" must be present and the ordering is only a small consideration for efficiency. (*) A tag mirror is a structure that has one element for each of a tagâs parameters, accessible by that parameter name (e.g. MyTag\\IODevice). These should only be used by advanced VTScada programmers.",

        "description": "Required. Any text expression giving the format of how the values (Vn parameters) are to be written. This format is similar, but not identical, to the C language format string for the printf function, whereby each of the Vn parameters in the statement is assigned to a % format specification in the order in which each appears in the list. Note that like a standard text string, these format specifiers must also be enclosed by double quotes. If a format specification appears for which there are no remaining V parameters, the format specification characters themselves are output to the stream exactly as they appear in the Format. For the % format specifications, the following form applies (where the [ ] indicates optional elements): %[-][+][SPACE][#][width][.precision]type where % (percent sign) is mandatory; -  (minus sign) (optional) causes the data to be left justified within the field (for binary types b and ASCII character types c, this option is ignored); + (plus sign) (optional) causes positive numbers to be prefaced with a + sign (negative numbers are unaffected). This allows easy alignment of positive and negative numbers in a printed column of numbers. For binary types b and non-numerical types, this option is ignored; space represents the single space character, and is similar to the [ + ] option but places a single space rather than a plus sign in front of positive numbers (negative numbers are still unaffected). This allows alignment of a column of numbers without having to show all signs. For binary types b and non-numerical types, this option is ignored; # (hash mark) When used with the o , x , or X format, the # flag prefixes any nonzero output value with 0, 0x, or 0X, respectively. width is a number that specifies the minimum number of characters to output. Numbers that require more characters than specified by the width value are truncated on output. If the number of characters in the number or string is less than width, blanks will be added to the left or right, depending upon whether the output is left or right justified (i.e. whether the [ - ] option has been specified) until the width is reached. For binary types b and ASCII character types c, this option is ignored; precision has a different meaning for each of the type options as follows: Integer types d, l, u, o, x, and X precision specifies the minimum number of digits to output. If the number contains fewer digits, leading zeroes will be added to the left of the number. If precision is 0, omitted, or if the decimal point appears without a number following it, the precision defaults to 1. The number is not truncated. Floating point types e and E precision specifies the number of digits after the decimal point. The last digit is rounded. The default precision in this case is 6. If the precision is 0 or if the decimal point appears without a number following it, no decimal point appears in the output. Floating point type f precision specifies the number of digits after the decimal point. The last digit is rounded. The default precision is 0. If the precision is explicitly 0, no decimal point is output. If a decimal point is output, at least one digit will be placed before the decimal point. Floating point types g and G precision specifies the maximum number of significant digits to be output. If no precision is specified, all significant digits are written. String type s precision specifies the maximum number of characters of the string to be output. If the string contains more characters than specified by the precision, the string is truncated and only the first characters are written. If the precision is not specified, all of the string characters are output. Byte type c  The precision option is ignored. Binary type b  The precision option is ignored. type is mandatory. The type specification must be one of those listed below. Note: The case of the letter is important. Specifying a character for the type that is not in this list will result in all the characters following the % up to that point to be output exactly as they appear in the Format string. Type Meaning nb Binary format; where n is a number indicating the type of value (see below). c Single character (byte values from 0 to 255) d Signed decimal 64-bit integer, 64-bit output by default e Signed exponential; exponent key is \"e\". E Signed exponential; exponent key is \"E\". f Signed floating point. g e or f format, whichever is shorter. G E or f format, whichever is shorter. h Handle to a window. i Signed decimal 64-bit integer, 64-bit output by default o Unsigned octal integer. Default 32-bit integer. Use %llo to output 64-bit value. p Pointer to a buffer. s Text string. t Writes a utf-8 string as used by OPC UA binary TCP: a 32-bit signed count of the length (-1 for an invalid string, 0 for an empty string), then the string u Unsigned decimal 64-bit integer, 64-bit output by default x Unsigned hex integer using \"abcdef\". Default 32-bit integer. (See following note.) X Unsigned hex integer using \"ABCDEF\". Default 32-bit integer. (See following note.) When writing negative values using either x or X format codes, the output will use a minimum of 32 bits because that is the smallest possible size to display the full information. Defining a format string such as \"%4X\" will not reduce this to 16 bit output for negative values. To output 64-bit values, use the modifier ll. %llx and %llX output 64-bit values. nb ,  Binary type  For the format specification of %nb, where n specifies the type of number, n must be a single digit from one of the following choices. All are low-byte-first. n Value Type 0 Byte, unsigned 1 Signed short integer (2 bytes) 2 Signed long integer (4 bytes) 3 IEEE single precision float (4 bytes) 4 <obsolete> 5 IEEE double precision float (8 bytes) 6 <obsolete> 7 Unsigned short integer (2 bytes) 8 Unsigned long integer (4 bytes) 9 Writes a time in Microsoft FILETIME format, which contains a 64-bit value representing the number of 100-nanosecond intervals since January 1, 1601 (UTC). 10 Outputs signed 64-bit integers in binary form. Note: Other options such as width and precision do not apply to the b type. c ,  Byte type:  This type is not representative of a single character in a string, but rather, represents single bytes. Input values (the Vn parameter to which this format specification applies) must be integers in the range of 0 to 255. Strings are not acceptable input values. Note that the %c format specifier behaves differently when used in an output statement such as BuffWrite than when used in an input statement, such as BuffRead. Some UTF-8 characters can require multiple bytes. Values from 0-127 are consistent between the traditional ASCII encoding and the UTF-8 encoding. d ,  Signed decimal 64-bit integer: e ,  Signed exponential:  Exponent key is \"e\" E ,  Signed exponential:  Exponent key is \"E\" f ,   Signed floating point g ,  e or f formats:  Whichever is shorter G,  E or F formats :  Whichever is shorter h ,  Window handle type:  This type is used for building structures to be handed to DLLs and should be used by advanced users only. p ,  Buffer pointer type:  This type is also used for building structures to be handed to DLLs and should be used by advanced users only. s ,  Text string type: t ,  Writes a utf-8 string as used by OPC UA binary TCP: a 32-bit signed count of the length (-1 for an invalid string, 0 for an empty string), then the string u ,  Unsigned decimal 64-bit integer, x ,  Unsigned hex integer using \"abcdef\": 32-bit value by default. Use modifier %llx for 64-bit value output. X ,  Unsigned hex integer using \"ABCDEF\": 32-bit value by default. Use modifier %llX for 64-bit value output. SWrite(Strm, \"%z92\",  \"Something \\to\\ be escaped\"); Gives the output:  Something \\\\to\\\\ be escaped Plain text Text in the Format parameter is written exactly as it appears, with three exceptions: Percentage sign (%)  Because format specifications for the Vn parameters are indicated by a percentage sign, to include an actual percentage sign as part of the Format parameter, precede it with a backslash character (i.e. \\%). Backslash character (\\)  Because this is used to indicate special control characters such as line feed, carriage return, and form feed, to write a backslash as part of the Format parameter, use two backslash characters (i.e. \\\\). Quotation marks (\")  The entire test string is delimited by quotation marks, so to include a set of quotation marks as part of the Format parameter, use a set of quotations marks (i.e. \"\"). Control characters In order to encode certain control characters as part of the Format parameter, one of two methods may be used. The first is to use a backslash character followed by one of the single character codes listed below to produce the desired result (notice that the letters must be lower case): Code Meaning \\b Backspace \\f Form feed \\n Line feed \\r Carriage return \\t Horizontal tab \\v Vertical tab \\nnn In addition to the above predefined codes, \\nnn may be used, where nnn is a three digit integer in the range of 0 to 255 specifying a certain ASCII character. If the number contains less than three digits, the leading spaces must be padded with zeroes; this is not the case with the previously listed single character control characters. For example, to include the one byte ASCII character G in the output, you could place its decimal equivalent of 71 in the Format string as \\071. znnn Escape character where nnn is the 3-digit ASCII code For example: SWrite(Strm, \"%z92\",  \"Something \\to\\ be escaped\"); Gives the output:  Something \\\\to\\\\ be escaped Offset is any numeric expression giving the starting buffer position in  bytes for the write, starting at 0."

The function will immediately return a value of false (0) unless a parameter was invalid, in which case it will return true (1). Note that the return value only signals completion of the function's execution if it is true, otherwise the function will continue executing in its thread. If StartDate is given a negative value, indicating that a particular entry is to be retrieved, it must be stressed that the file being read by the TGet may or may not contain an invalid record at the end of the file. If the Save that created the file was given a negative number for its Buffers parameter, the invalid record would not have been written to the file, however, a zero or positive value for Buffers will mean that the last record of the file will be one whose fields are all invalid and whose time and date stamp reflect the cessation of writing to the file by the Save. If FieldNum is an array with more than one element, then TGet will retrieve multiple fields from the file. In this case, ArrayElem must represent an array with at least two dimensions. The requested values will be returned in a manner analogous to GetHistory, with the data for a column in the rightmost dimension, and the column index in the previous dimension. When FieldNum is specified as an array, Mode or StaleTime, or both, may be specified as either a single value or an array of values. If a single value is specified, that value will be used for each of the fields specified in FieldNum. If an array of values is specified, the first element in the array will be applied to the first element of FieldNum, and so on. If PathPrefix is specified, then this changes the interpretation of the File parameter. In this case, the referenced file is not the source of the data, but a file containing references to other files which are the data sources. This file should be in standard VTScada logfile format and should contain a file reference as the first text value of each record (other values are ignored). The records should be in the correct time order with respect to the data files. The value of the PathPrefix is a string, which when prefixed to one of the file references, will yield a full pathname to the target file. If no prefix is required, but expansion of the dataset is required, then PathPrefix should be an empty string. If a filename entry does NOT begin with a \"\\\" or \"<drive letter>:\\\", then the PathPrefix will be prepended to the filename. If a filename entry DOES begin with \"<drive letter>:\\\", then the PathPrefix will NOT be prepended to the filename. If a filename entry does begin with a \"\\\", then the \"<drive letter>:\" from the PathPrefix will be prepended to the filename. If there is no \"<drive letter>:\" in the PathPrefix then the \"<drive letter>:\" from the path of the File parameter will be used instead. PathPrefix would normally be the application path.",

Great care should be exercised when using this function since each thread created by Windowsâ¢ uses certain system resources and will by its very existence slightly slow the running of the application. In general, the Thread function should only be used when a module would otherwise monopolize system resources to such an extent that other critical modules would be severely hampered in their execution. This function returns an object value of the newly started module, in the same way that Launch does. This means that parameters are passed to the module as a value only, and if the module instance changes one of their values, its value will not change outside of the scope of the threaded module. Variables external to the module that the module itself will be required to alter should reside within the scope of Parent and be set directly, rather than passed as parameters.",

    "comments": "This command will require a knowledge of SQL (Structured Query Language). This function is typically used when a large amount of data is being processed. When TODBC is executed in its script, it starts its own thread and VTScada will continue executing. When the TODBC statement is finished executing, it will set the data in Attrib, give the resultant table in Result and set ErrorCode. Some SQL statements, such as the one for inserting a record into a table, do not return any data, in this case the only indication that the thread has terminated will be that ErrorCode will be set to a valid value - 0 if no errors occurred. Notice that unlike ODBC, the resultant table is returned in one of the parameters, rather than as a return value and the last three parameters are not optional. If any error, no matter how minor, occurs as a result of the SQL command having been executed, and the TODBCConnect or ODBCConnect that connected to the database had its Disconnect parameter set true, the value of DB will become invalid (i.e. the connection to the database will be dropped). This includes such trivial indiscretions as using an incorrect table name in the SQL command. Differences between blocking and non-blocking ODBC calls: Prior to VTS version 10.0, executing one of the following blocking ODBC operations - ODBC, ODBCTables, ODBCConnect, ODBCDisconnect, ODBCBeginTrans, ODBCCommit or ODBCRollback would cause all VTScada script code execution and window painting to suspend until the operation was complete. From VTS 10.0 onwards, only the VTScada script thread making the call is suspended. All other threads and window painting continue to function. Prior to VTS version 10.0, a non-blocking ODBC operation was used to avoid this issue (same set of operations with a 'T' prepended). This leads to more complex script code insofar as you have to initiate an operation in a script and wait for completion in steady-state, but did allow script threads and window painting to continue. However, the Txxx operations were more time consuming to execute, as they each spin up a thread to execute the operation asynchronously. From VTS 10.0 onwards, these operations are more efficient - there is now no performance difference between the Txxx non-blocking variants and the blocking ones. As blocking ODBC calls no longer suspend all other threads, the only reason for using a Txxx variant call is where you wish to allow other script code statements in the same VTScada script thread to execute while the ODBC operation is processing.",

If your application predates version 11.2, use the backslash notation rather than dot: \\System\\ Steps can be calculated by subtracting the number of visible items from the total number of scrollable items. PageLen is equal to the number of visible items. Items can be thought of as rows, where a row will have a height of N pixels. As an example, consider an Alarm Page that is showing 50 alarms, where only 20 of them are visible. The operator needs to click the down arrow on the scrollbar 30 times to reach the bottom of the alarm list, so Steps would be set to 30. If the operator clicks on the scrollbar area other than the  tab, they expect to see it scroll by a \"page\", which in this example is 20 rows. PageLen would therefore be set to 20. In some situations you may want the down arrow to move more than one row at a time, say 3 rows, so you would set StepSize to 3. Note that there is no need to provide the width of the row in pixels to VScrollbar. Custom script graphics using the VScrollbar module directly need to pass in a window object to serve as source for the mouse wheel messages. Typically this would be the window that the VScrollbar module is controlling. Note that the VScrollbar module itself uses a native windows scrollbar, which will therefore work automatically without any script changes, so long as the mouse pointer is over the actual scrollbar.",

Not supported by the Anywhere client. 23 Window may serve as a palette, from which GUITransforms may be dragged. Not supported by the Anywhere client. 24 If set along with bit 23, the window that is the source of the object being dragged will hide itself automatically during the drag operation. 25 Hide horizontal scrollbar 26 Hide vertical scrollbar (Setting both bits 25 and 26 is the same as setting bit 8, disable scroll bars) Notes on the style settings: The default window (if Style is set to 0) has a thick border and is resizable. If bit 1 is not set, the title bar is not shown, and bits 0, 4 and 5 have no effect. If bits 2 and 3 are both set, there will not be a border unless bit 1 is set, in which case there will be a thin border. If neither bit 2 nor bit 3 is set, the border will be a resizable thick border. Bits 4 and 5 specify whether minimize and maximize buttons are disabled, rather than specifying whether they are visible (both the minimize and maximize buttons will be either visible or not visible). Furthermore, these options have no effect without bit 0 being set (except under Windows NT 3.51). The system close button must be enabled for the user to have any control over the minimize and maximize buttons. Setting bit 8 disables the scroll bars that are normally shown if the window has been resized (smaller). In this case, the entire window must be enlarged to its original size if you wish to view its contents. Bit 9 (child window) specifies a \"window within a window\". The new window is another graphic object within the calling window and is truncated by the borders of the parent window. This means that as the parent window is dragged, the child stays on top of the parent window in the same position within and relative to the parent's borders. If the parent window is minimized, then the child window is also minimized. Child windows do not produce status line title-windows. It is impossible to make a window a child window if the Window statement is in a module that isn't running in a window already. A child window is always an owned window. Setting bit 12 means that the window will take all of the input until closed. Care should be taken when using this option in conjunction with bit 14 (size based on load). A problem will occur if the load file cannot be found, and the window will not show up but will still be modal. The result is that the system will take no input until the window is closed. Setting bit 14 hides the window until a Load statement is executed in Module. The window is then opened in the size required to display the loaded image. Bit 15 (owned window) creates a window that is always in front of the calling window. Unlike child windows, which are controlled by their parents, owned windows are not restricted by their owner's boundaries, nor does the movement of the parent window change their position. The exception to this, however, is that if the owning window is minimized, the owned window will also be minimized. Owned windows do not produce status line title-windows. Although all child windows are owned, not all owned windows are child windows. Bit 17. An alpha-blended window is one that has an alpha channel set up in the final renderer, resulting in a translucent effect to the window (i.e. it behaves like a normal window, except that you can see through the window to some degree. The degree of translucency ranges from zero (invisible) to 255 (completely opaque, just like a normal window). Setting bit 17 on your Window statement invokes \"automatic\" alpha blending, where the window is set to be 50% translucent when inactive and opaque when active. This is useful for dialogs that are non-modal and always on-top, so that when another window is active, you can see through to the underlying windows. If you need a finer degree of control on this, do not set bit 17, but use a new value for the \"Option\" parameter of WindowOptions (9) and set the WindowOptions \"OptValue\" parameter to the degree of alpha-blending that you wish (0 to 255). Note that these effects DO NOT work with child windows. Also note that these effects are NOT designed for animation purposes are not sufficiently efficient for this. The amount of processing power required to redraw one of these windows depends on the rating of the graphics card in your machine. The newer and faster the better. Bit 18. A transparent window is one that has a transparent background. The intended use for this is to allow the display of non-rectangular windows, by rendering the background as transparent and allowing mouse messages (movement and clicks) to \"drill-through\" the transparent area. The simplest way to create a transparent window is to specify a background color less than zero (-1, for example). The underlying implementation, however, requires that a specific color is used as a \"key\" color. All pixels of that color in the otherwise rectangular screen area that the window occupies are rendered as transparent. Using a background color of < 0 results in the key color being black [i.e. RBG(0, 0, 0)] and the window background being set to that color. It may well be that you wish to have black as a color in your window, however. Therefore, setting bit 18 in the Window statement also announces that this window is to be rendered as transparent, with whatever color is specified as the background color being the transparent color. A WinXLoc/WinYLoc statement for the new window registers the values for the parent window when the mouse is over the parent and not itself, and will register the values for itself when the mouse is over it. The same is also true for the parent (it will see the values for the child window when the mouse is over the child). Bits 22 and 23 are mutually exclusive. A window cannot be both a palette and a drop-target."

    "comments": "This function returns the value returned by Module. When a window is maximized, its maximized size is not based on the size of the screen, although for many commercial applications the two are the same, but rather, its full size is defined by the fifth and sixth parameters, namely virtual width and height. If the view area and the virtual area of the window have been defined to be the same, selecting the maximize button will appear to have no effect. The minimum size of a window is based on the operating system under which the application is running, as well as the attributes of the window itself as defined by the Style parameter. The width need only be greater than or equal to 0. Window heights similarly need only be greater than or equal to 0. GUITransform functions may make use of VStatus to inquire about the boundaries of the window they are within. A window can be turned into a drag and drop target by adding the callback modules, OLEDrag and OLEDrop. Further details can be found in the chapter, Create Windows & Use Graphics Functions. If a ribbon is to be associated with this window, then the ribbon must be instantiated at the same time that the window is created, using the two optional parameters, RibbonName and RibbonState. Ribbons are compiled into resources, using Microsoft Visual Studio. The resources can then be linked directly into VTS.EXE (Trihedral use only) or into an external DLL. This allows multiple ribbons to be provided in separate DLLs. You can have more than one ribbon in VTS.EXE or a DLL. RibbonName is of the form \"dllname|ribbonname\", being the name of the DLL, a vertical pipe symbol and the name of the ribbon resource within the DLL. If the ribbon is compiled into VTS, the dllname and the pipe separator character are omitted. If adding a ribbon to a window, and if there is a chance that the window will be maximized, you should use the window's virtual width and virtual height as follows: Window(0, 0, 1024, 768,\r\n       VStatus(Self(), 26), VStatus(Self(), 27) + VSTatus(Self(), 23), ...

For any page or widget, or other window do not use WindowClose because you cannot know if WindowClose is already being used with that window (as is likely the case). If this function is active when an attempt to close a window is made, the window will not close, and the module(s) in that window will not stop. It is up to the calling module to close the window and stop the module(s) by switching to another state. This function may be used to control what happens when a window is closed (or to prevent it from being closed). When the attempt is made to close the window, an action (or actions) can be triggered. For example, this might write some data to file. Then a variable could be set (or a value could be returned by the module) which signals the calling module to switch states, which closes the window and stops the module(s) inside. Notes on closing a window: When WindowClose behavior is active, the typical way to close a window is by making one of the following happen: The Enable parameter to the Window() function changes to false. The state where the Window() function is running in steady state stops. This is typically achieved by doing one of two things: The calling object's state changes away from the state containing the Window() function. The calling object is slain. Calling Slay on the root object of the window does not work. (For example, calling Slay(Self) from the window's root object.) The root object of the window is called in steady-state, from the Window function's 7th parameter. Slaying an object that has been called in steady-state does nothing because it does not affect the calling object: the calling object would still be in it's same state with that same Window() call running, and therefore the called Window module cannot be permitted to stop. If the calling object is launched, then a common approach is to slay that calling object. For example, Slay(Caller(Self)) rather than Slay(Self) may work, depending on how the object was launched.",
