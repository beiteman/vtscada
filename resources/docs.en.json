            "\tznnn, Escape characters: This specifies an escape character that will",

            "\tused as the sole format specifier that reads an entire string, spaces",
            "\tincluded, discarding every single occurrence of an escape character,",
            "\tor the first occurrence of every pair of escape characters. For",

            "\teach occurrence of X, the character immediately following it is saved,",
            "\teven if it is itself an escape character. Then the next occurrence of",
            "\tthe escape character is discarded, with the character following it",
            "\tbeing saved, regardless of what it is, and so on. The width field",
            "\tspecifies the maximum number of bytes to place in the output string;",
            "\tif this number is smaller than the input string (less the offending",
            "\tescape characters), the string will be truncated. If no width is",
